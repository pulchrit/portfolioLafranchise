            <p>
                I’ve included a bit more information about who I am, what I’ve been doing 
                recently, and my plans for the future below. 
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subhead">Diligent, reliable, organized</h2>
            <p>
                My ample work experience has allowed me to understand my strengths. 
                I’m diligent, reliable, and organized. While working as a Project 
                Manager in the Marketing Communications at ResMed, I was responsible 
                for an average of 14 projects ranging from single page collateral 
                revisions to multi-deliverable, multi-phased product launches. 
                Six years after I left, I received a call from the principle of 
                a marketing agency I had worked with while there. She offered me 
                a Project Manager position with her company because she remembered 
                me and the work that I did. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I earned the respect of the design teams and the Product Managers 
                whom I worked with by gathering and prioritizing relevant information 
                in a single source, defining reasonable schedules, monitoring progress, 
                and communicating on a scheduled and ad hoc basis to alleviate any 
                confusion about product specs or project timelines. After projects 
                were completed, post mortem meetings were held to learn what worked 
                and where there was room for improvement. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This Project Manager role also helped sharpen my ability to understand 
                how to work with and learn from each member of a team to become a 
                productive and cohesive whole. 
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subhead">Patience and grit</h2>
            <p>
                My most recent efforts have centered on nurturing twin daughters 
                and preparing them for the world beyond the home. Raising the 
                girls has been both supremely challenging and rewarding. It’s 
                taken incredible effort and taught me a lot about patience and 
                grit. During naptime and after bedtime, I started honing my 
                technical skills to begin a career transition to web development.
            </p>
               
            <h2 class="subhead">Curious</h2>
            <p>
                My interest in coding was sparked when completing my Master’s 
                degree in Library and Information Science. I focused on information 
                organization and took a few intro web development classes and 
                enjoyed the challenge of solving programming puzzles so much, 
                I decided to make a transition to a web development career. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my recent projects is an asynchronous web app using 
                the Fetch API and  jQuery called <a href="poetry-count-app/index.html">Poems, computed</a>. 
                It queries a poetry API for poems by a particular poet, 
                does a word frequency analysis on these poems, and 
                translates the results into a Highcharts word chart. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another recent app created using React and React Router 
                necessitated querying the New York Times Best Sellers Lists API 
                and the Open Library API to display the top children’s books 
                and provide links to more information about each book. One 
                of the challenges lay in getting this app working smoothly 
                on my personal website. After researching the issue, and with 
                a little help, I put together the right combination of a 
                basename for my routes, the right code in an htaccess file, 
                and the right specs in the package.json file to get 
                <a href="more-books-please/">this app</a> working. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a life-long learner, I’m always curious to learn more 
                and different things. Being challenged keeps me engaged. 
            </p>
