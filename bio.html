            <p>
                 
                I’ve included a bit more information about who I am, what I’ve been doing 
                recently, and my plans for the future below. 
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subhead">Diligent, reliable, organized</h2>
            <p>
                My ample work experience has allowed me to understand my strengths. 
                I’m diligent, reliable, and organized. I’ll do the work without complaint. 
                When you ask me to handle something, it will get done. I’ll make a plan and 
                remain rigorously focused on project goals even when things take unexpected turns.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subhead">Patience and grit</h2>
            <p>
                My most recent efforts have centered on nurturing twin daughters and 
                preparing them for the world beyond the home. Raising the girls has been 
                both supremely challenging and rewarding. It’s taken incredible effort and 
                taught me a lot about patience and grit. When my girls turned two, I started 
                honing my technical skills to begin a career transition to web development. 
            </p>
               
            <h2 class="subhead">Curious</h2>
            <p>
                Building a program that processes information or a website that communicates 
                clearly are enjoyable and fulfilling creative expressions for me. I also enjoy 
                solving the puzzles and problems that arise along the way. As a life-long learner, 
                I’m always curious to learn more and different things&mdash;whether 
                that is a new programming language or more about a business or organization whose 
                website I’m creating. The need to continuously learn new languages and skills 
                helps to keep me challenged and engaged. I'm also interested in learning from and 
                contributing to a productive team. 
            </p>
                    
            <h2 class="subhead">Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Please review my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> for a better understanding 
                of my technical experience and <a href="mailto:pulchrit@gmail.com">email me</a> with 
                any questions. 
            </p> 

            <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
