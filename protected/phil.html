                      <h2>Professional Philosophy</h2>

                       <p>My chosen career pathway will be one related to web programming and information architecture. My future employment will most likely be found in a non-LIS environment. Given my prior 14 years of experience working in various marketing communications roles within the corporate world, I feel that this future career goal makes most sense for me in that it draws on my past experience and my strengths and interests as realized through the MLIS program.</p>

                        <p>I also feel that a non-traditional LIS environment will make sense for more and more MLIS students as time goes on, especially as LIS training is increasingly related to the use of technology in todayâ€™s digital era. A shift away from the library as the core, traditional environment and a move towards developing information professionals who might practice in any number of organizations of which a library is one possibility though not the primary and expected one. Reaching out to various other professions, in my mind, can only serve to benefit information professionals who seem, at least in many of my course readings, to feel slighted by other professions. Instead of insulating, I believe it would make sense for those LIS professionals who are comfortable doing so to actively seek employment outside of traditional environments. I believe that this will not only bolster the reputation of the profession but will also help ensure its broad applicability and longevity. In one respect this will mean giving up the control that is tied to a traditional LIS setting, like a library, but it should also mean increased influence across many different settings in which information is traded. I have seen a tendency towards something like this thinking in many of my technology related courses.</p>

                        <p>Regarding my professional goals in particular, I would enjoy a web programming/design role. Ideally, I will find a part-time, virtual position in the short term to allow me to manage the care of my twin daughters until such time that they attend school while allowing me to contribute to the family income, and perform a job that will actually be quite enjoyable. As shown in my e-Portfolio evidence and discussions, I believe I excelled in information retrieval, web usability, web design, and other technology courses. Equally, I truly enjoyed these courses. The subject matter was interesting, the problem solving was challenging but rewarding, and, at the end, I was able to create a functional entity that would benefit others (e.g., a web site or Javascript program). This non-traditional LIS career path seems a wonderful confluence of my interests and strengths. My professional goals include expanding these web programming skills intially through online tutorials to expand my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP/MySQL, but also to learn new languages like AngularJS and Ruby.</p>

                        <p>In terms of applying my philosophy and professional goals to contribute to the cultural, economic, educational, and social well-being of our communities, with a non-traditional LIS career planned, some of the more straightforward claims of contribution are not as easy to demonstrate (e.g., cultural contributions). However, wherever I ultimately work, I will certainly be contributing to the economy by supporting some sort of product or information exchange. Any efforts to organize information and provide continuing access to it over generations contributes to a continuation of the culture, and given the interaction allowed by the Internet, this begins to effect a truly global community. Equally, I feel that the web programming/development career will allow for much flexibility in the type of organization I ultimately am employed with. Non-profits need web developers just as much as for-profit companies do.</p>
