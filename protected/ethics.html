                        <h2>1. Ethics, Values, and Principles of LIS</h2>

                        <p>Donald Cleveland and Ana Cleveland provide a concise definition of ethics: “In the simplest sense, a code of ethics allows people and organizations to make decisions and carry out actions based on an understanding of what is right and what is wrong” (2013, p. 316). The simplicity of this definition belies the complex reality of applying a code of ethics.</p>

                        <p>With the goal of maintaining a “free flow of information and ideas to present and future generations” (2008), the American Library Association (ALA) offers a robust, yet flexible, set of guidelines for ensuring the ethical behavior of its members. It realizes the impracticality of trying to dictate behavior in every instance and instead offers guidelines that can be variously applied in particular situations. These include: provide equitable service to all patrons, ensure intellectual freedom and resist censorship, protect patrons’ privacy, respect intellectual property rights, treat co-workers with respect, maintain a separation between personal and professional agendas, and continuously improve skills.</p>

                        <p>The Society of American Archivists also provides a code of ethics for its members, and while there are similarities with the ALA code, there are particular aspects of the profession that require special note, including exercising judgment in the accessioning and processing of collections, ensuring the authenticity of materials in a collection, and protecting materials from damage and theft (Society of American Archivists [SAA], 2012).</p>

                        <p>Several examples will illustrate the point about the complexity of applying a code of ethics. It can be difficult to balance the need to respect personal privacy and the need to share information for the benefit or protection of others (e.g., USA Patriot Act requests for patron-specific circulation information, Rubin, 2010). It is challenging to protect access to all information when that protection is at odds with corporate business interests (e.g., the battle to maintain net neutrality, Rubin, 2010). Finally, it can be very difficult to respect the values of multiple groups of people when those values come into direct conflict with each other (e.g., the unfortunate censorship and restriction of the book In Our Mothers’ House by the Davis Utah School District stemming from one group of parents enforcing their values on all students instead of just their own children, Polacco, 2012).</p>

                        <p>Intellectual freedom—“the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction”—is significant in LIS organizations because they seek to meet the education, entertainment, and information needs of their users (ALA, n.d). It is through the wide variety of perspectives and knowledge that the populace gains from institutions like libraries that it is empowered to participate in this country’s democracy and culture (ALA, n.d.). The “free flow of information and ideas”, to again quote the ALA Code of Ethics (2008), facilitates the gathering of perspectives and knowledge by preventing the censorship of information.</p>

                        <p>Though the values of library professionals have always been altruistic, historically, the manner in which they have been applied is, in my opinion, not necessarily in accord with a modern interpretation of intellectual freedom, which includes the equal access to information in a variety of forms. To clarify, one of the most compelling observations for me in Wiegand’s Main Street Public Library: Community Places and Reading Spaces in the Rural Heartland, 1876-1956 was his comparison between the proposed ideal and the reality of library functions. It was interesting to see how libraries moved through periods of social control and moral instruction to periods of social inclusion, community service, and recognition of the fact that the library was there to give the patrons what they want (i.e. fiction). Libraries were not only tools for the highbrow education of the democratic populace. They were instead what the local people needed them to be. When given a purely voluntary choice of how to interact with the public library, it is understandable that patrons chose books, topics, and activities that would give them pleasure and fulfillment, especially when one considers the other restrictions they faced from school, work, or religion. Further, while Wiegand clearly illustrates that past library scholarship has tended to denigrate popular fiction, he shows that it is not merely vacuous entertainment but a very real source of social education for those who chose to read it. Granted, most people didn’t search out books with topics they would find contrary and upsetting to their beliefs, so the educational value resided in reinforcement rather than in the introduction of challenging new ideas. Happily, today’s libraries seem to be supportive of the modern equivalents of popular fiction in the guise of computer games, maker spaces, and media centers. Perhaps Wiegand’s conclusions illustrate the beginnings of a postmodern inclusionary culture that is arguably culminating in today’s globally networked society.</p>

                        <p>As another example, McCrossen in her article “‘One Cathedral More’ or ‘Mere Lounging Places for Bummers’? The Cultural Politics of Leisure and the Public Library in Gilded Age America” clearly illustrates the differentiation between what was considered acceptable reading and what was considered less than acceptable reading in the space of the Boston Public Library. The serious reading room for non-fiction and classics was separate from the lowbrow reading room for newspapers and light fiction. Her description of the rather squalid conditions of the light fiction reading room shows that, even with high ideals, LIS professionals can stray from providing equitable access to all forms of materials that support the education, entertainment, and information needs of their patrons by applying restrictions that, though inadvertently, actually impede intellectual freedom.</p>

                        <p>Values, ethics, and principles in LIS professions help to unify individual practitioners into a comprehensive and, as much as possible, consistent whole. Without such guides, libraries and archives across the country would potentially have different standards for such activities as interacting with patrons, providing access to materials, or ensuring intellectual freedom.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>My first piece of evidence illustrates the complexity of applying ethical principles related to access to services in a library setting and was a <a href="pdfs/LIBR200_Discussion_Ethics.pdf" title="Link to ethics examples">discussion post for LIBR 200 Information and Society</a>. In this section of the course, we were learning about theories that help with solving ethical dilemmas. I chose to evaluate the question of allowing an odoriferous homeless person access to the library by applying a rights-based and a consequence-based theory. In the first instance, the question became not how a homeless person is contributing to society but if they are attempting to do by using the libraries resources. Though homeless, they are still a member of the public and should be given equal access rights to library services. Using Rawls idea of the veil of ignorance, I concluded that I myself might be a homeless person trying to use public resources available to me, and I would feel that I deserved access to the library. I also questioned the definition of smelly by mentioning that it’s possible that a library patron could be considered smelly due to the over-application of cologne or perfume or by virtue of their job (i.e., chef or auto mechanic). Would they too be prevented from accessing services at some point? The consequence-based theory led me to the same conclusion of allowing access because enabling a homeless person to improve their station in life through library resources and contribute to society would increase happiness in the world. Denying them access would certainly not increase happiness and might possibly reduce it. Further, though a homeless person’s smell might very well adversely affect other patrons, at minimum, those patrons have the option of moving to another part of the library that they find more comfortable. In this example, I demonstrated the difficulty of navigating an ethical question where the rights of different patron groups come into conflict and found that it is the ALA’s Code of Ethics along with the particulars of the situation that assisted in making ethical decisions. For instance, the conclusion would be different if the homeless person was using the library as a shelter rather than utilizing library services. I stand by my analysis of this ethical dilemma today.</p>

                        <p>My second piece of evidence is included in <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_FinalExamEssay2_copyrightprivacy.pdf" title="Link to copyright and privacy example">my LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts final exam</a>; the second essay question is related to copyright and privacy issues in an archives. The situation involved the use of a photo in an exhibit about a state senator. The photo was not part of the archives’ collection; it was found on the website of a third party called Tomorrow’s Happy Citizens (THC) and was assumed to have been taken at a rally in support of the Senator. It showcased the Senator surrounded by other people. The photo’s owner and copyright status were unknown. The dilemma was to decide if the photo should be used in the exhibit, why or why not, and how to cite it if it was used. I began by describing the variety of questions I’d ask of THC with the goal of establishing ownership, copyright, and basic information about the event. I then described the legal and ethical problems related to copyright, privacy, and the Freedom of Information Act. Not knowing the owner, I assumed it best to consider the photo as still being under copyright. As the physical exhibit would generally be intended for non-profit educational purposes, I suggested the photo’s use would be covered under the fair use provision of Title 17 of the United States Code on copyright—even without explicit permission. The online aspect of the exhibit was more worrisome in that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 does require permission for use. I followed this with a summary of the privacy issues connected to the individuals shown in the photo and cautioned that, even if use wasn’t restricted by copyright, the archives was obligated to preserve those individuals’ right to privacy. Again more information was required. The Senator had only recently retired, so it was most likely that all supporters and staffers in the photo would still be alive. If the photo was taken at a public event, and the subjects knew they were being photographed, and was then published in a newspaper, privacy concerns would be lessened as the photo would already be in the public domain. My next point regarded the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which comes into play because the Senator was a government official and citizens have a right to the photo if he was acting in his official capacity when it was taken. The next part of the scenario involved how the photo might be captioned if used and what to do about the fact that one of the Senator’s staffer’s name tags was readable. I explained that if THC was the photo’s owner and had provided permission for me to use it, I would caption it by only mentioning the Senator by name. If any photo manipulation was done to blur the staffer’s name tag, I would include mention of this manipulation in the caption. I concluded my essay with a summary of the contingencies involved and their bearing on my decision to most likely not use the photo. This decision was based on not only the ethical issues, but because the photo wasn’t even part of the archives’ collection, nor was it related to the Senator’s hallmark legislation. I pointed out that the exhibit should increase the public’s awareness of the archives and that a copyright or privacy lawsuit would be a very detrimental way to publicize the archives. Equally, to me, use of the photo as a centerpiece of the exhibit seemed strange when the image was not a part of the archives’ actual collection. I still feel my navigation of the copyright, privacy, and FOIA issues is sound today.</p>

                        <p>As specifically relates to intellectual freedom and censorship issues, I provide one of the <a href="pdfs/LIBR280_Exercise4num8_censorship.pdf" title="Link to censorship example">identification topics from my LIBR 280 History of Books and Libraries class</a>. We were tasked with identifying Richard Wright’s Black Boy and censorship of the work in five sentences. This example really does show the complexity involved in intellectual freedom and censorship. First, there is the overt censorship of the book itself and its banning from school curricula as recently as 1997. As with In Our Mothers’ House, a small group of parents are imposing their values on all students instead of only their own children. Second, is another form of censorship where the ‘n’ word is being redacted from the text in the name of political correctness. This amending of the author’s work raises intellectual property questions. At the same time, it brings up intellectual freedom issues as the audience is prevented from encountering and learning from the text in its powerfully disturbing original state.</p>

                        <p>I also include a <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_Discussion_censorship.pdf" title="Link to censorship example 2">discussion post written for LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts</a> in demonstration of my understanding of the complexity of intellectual freedom and censorship in LIS professions. A case scenario was presented where a university president stipulated the removal and destruction of materials referencing homosexual experiences from microfilm copies of the long-deceased university founder’s personal papers. The president’s reasoning was that researchers interested in that information could acquire it from the Library of Congress, the institution that provided the copies to the university and which held the originals. The dilemma was how, as the university archivist, you would respond to this decree. I described that my initial tactic would be to sit down with the president and review some of the hallmarks of the SAA Code of Ethics including the authenticity section, which specifically prohibits altering or destroying records to conceal facts, and the section on ensuring accessibility to materials, which requires that archivists make materials in their care readily available to those with an interest in them. I also explained that I would appeal to the president’s understanding of the founder as a complex human being, even if the president perhaps did not agree with certain of his actions. If the above failed to persuade the president, I described how I would then suggest splitting the papers into university related and personal memoirs, and either put the personal memoirs on some sort of restricted access in the university or simply not accept them from the Library of Congress. In either case, the archives would make it clear to researchers that the personal papers were available and explain how they could be accessed. In my mind, this at least made the distinction one between university-related, public papers and personal papers, rather than the quite discriminatory distinction made by removing only materials related to homosexuality. This is clearly a case of censorship resulting from the president’s personal beliefs, and the restriction and certainly the destruction of the materials adversely impacts the intellectual freedom of users of the university archives. My solutions to the dilemma were what I felt to be reasonable negotiations of complex issue. In looking at this case study today, I would also highlight the responsibility of the archives to preserve and protect all materials in its care—another stipulation of the SAA Code of Ethics—which would specifically counter the president’s request to have the microfilm copies of the materials in question destroyed. Other than this additional argument, I believe my analysis and suggestions for managing this situation were reasonable given the circumstances.</p>

                        <p>I believe the description of the ethical dilemma dealing with the homeless person from LIBR 200, the essay on managing copyright and privacy issues from LIBR 256, the brief identification of a censored work from LIBR 280, and the discussion post on responding to censorship in an archives from LIBR 256 evidence my ability to articulate the ethics, values, and principles of LIS professions as well demonstrate an understanding of the difficulty of fostering intellectual freedom in LIS environments.</p>
