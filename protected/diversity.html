                        <h2>3. Cultural and Economic Diversity</h2>

                        <p>Recognition of the diversity of a library or other knowledge organizations’ users is fundamental to ensuring the vitality, effectiveness, and success of the institution. A proper understanding of users allows an organization to fulfill its mission.
Several examples of cultural and economic diversity being reflected in service changes will illustrate the point. Having a growing minority population who speaks English as a second language, an institution might create hybrid adult literacy/English classes. Story hours may be offered in multiple languages to meet the needs of the audience, as illustrated by particular Multnomah County Library branches offering Vietnamese, Cantonese, and Mandarin story hours (Multnomah County Library, n.d.). Cultural diversity is also recognized by the Chicago Public Library which offers translations of its website in both Spanish and Polish to meet the needs of its two largest immigrant populations (Chicago Public Library, n.d.). If a library serves a large population of high-risk youth, then funding the teen center may be prioritized to transform it into a safe refuge offering teens homework help and mentoring as well as entertainment and socializing. If large portions of the user base lack Internet access at home, then the computing center of the library might perhaps be a focus of improvements in hardware and software, and design and layout of the physical space as well as extended operating hours.</p>

                        <p>There are other dimensions of meeting the needs of a diverse population. Managing collections to make reading “socially bonding” (Weigand, 2011, p. 6) for subgroups/cultures is important and, as Weigand reveals, is historically common in many U.S. libraries. As is recognizing the need to help unemployed or homeless members of society begin to reestablish themselves. We must also remember that diversity extends to those with impairments who require special accessibility features—not only to physical spaces, but virtual ones. Universal Design—meaning “the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design”—seems a particularly effective way to account for the needs of these groups (Connell et al., 1997).
Of course understanding cultural and economic diversity is not actually a recent phenomenon, as evidenced by Eisenstein’s (2005) comments on literacy in the middle ages. Our modern preconception is that the upper/educated classes were more likely to be literate than lower classes, and that the printing press finally made knowledge available to the “low-born men” which was previously reserved for “the high-born” (Eisenstein, 2006, p. 240). Eisenstein explains that manuscript booksellers were already catering to “the needs of lowly bakers and merchants as well as to those of lawyers, aldermen, or knights” (2006, p. 241) in the fifteenth century.  And Overty (2008) provides further evidence, noting that increased demand for manuscripts was the result of the economic recovery that was the hidden ‘benefit’ of the Black Death, namely “population contraction caused by numerous waves of plague had the effect of both increasing real wages and lowering prices, and thus greatly increasing disposable income” (Overty, 2008, p. 11). This income was used to send children to school thus increasing literacy, “especially in the vernacular” as opposed to Latin (Overty, 2008, p. 12). Increased literacy initiated a new market for vernacular writing and manuscript books, to which the book trade of the late Middle Ages responded. And granted both of these historic examples speak more to market forces, rather than the more altruistic role of libraries; however, the importance of understanding the diversity of users to meet their needs is the same.</p>

                        <p>Catering to the changing needs of the local population allows the library or information center to continue to fulfill its mission of providing accessible and relevant education, information and recreation resources to its population. Balancing the differing needs of diverse populations through programs and services is perhaps more difficult than the initial recognition of those differences, especially as it typically involves the allocation of limited resources among these programs and services. Simply put, if libraries and knowledge institutions do not understand the diverse needs of their users and adjust their programs, services, and collections to these needs, they will find that their audience quickly disappears making their institutions irrelevant.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>My first piece of evidence is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR200_Discussion_PostModernism.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on post-modernism">discussion post from LIBR 200 Information and Society covering post-modernism</a> and its effect on libraries by way of a brief review of several scholarly articles. As I relate in the post, the recognition of cultural and economic diversity—in fact all diversity—is a key tenant of post-modernism. In discussing Bodi and Maier-O’Shea’s article about information literacy, I explain that a post-modernist approach would see validity in both traditional and non-traditional information sources (i.e., recognizing cultural and economic diversity in sources) and would encourage information literacy instructors to explain the difference between such sources without negating one or the other (i.e., adjust services according to diversity).  Further, I mention how Greene’s article reinforces this idea of post-modernist inclusion in accepting both non-traditional sources as well as the users of those sources. My subsequent point revolves around how a knowledge institution might actively recognize diversity in its audience, and that is by listening to users rather than dictating to them. Bodi & Maier-O’Shea’s work is again mentioned as an example of how continuously listening to users to understand their diverse needs leads to service changes. In their case, the authors did away with traditional budget and collection categories in order to focus on providing the information required by their varied audience of faculty, and graduate and undergraduate students. I stand by this perspective on post-modernism and its ability to help information organizations recognize many kinds of diversity within their audiences and react to those differences by appropriately amending programs and services.</p>

                        <p>A LIBR 200 Information and Society discussion post also provides my next piece of evidence; this time the <a href="pdfs/LIBR200_Discussion_Ethics.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on ethics">topic was related to ethics</a>. I chose to analyze the issue of allowing library access to a homeless person with an offensive odor. The homeless are members of our society whom the library should serve, especially if that library seeks to recognize the economic diversity of its population. As I explain, a homeless person who seeks to use library services for self-improvement is valid user. They should be allowed access to the collection, the job center, or courses on resume writing and the like. In terms of adjusting library services, my suggestion was not for the library to become a homeless shelter, but rather for the library to actively seek a partnership with a local homeless shelter to, at the very least, create hygiene kits, which the library could then distribute to homeless users. Certainly, the partnership could extend beyond this to a scenario in which the shelter provided pamphlets about their own services that could be distributed at the library, or even a situation where a counselor from the shelter could come to the library for a hour or two a day seeking out homeless library visitors and actively counseling them on how to make the best use of the library’s services. Again, the homeless population is not a glamorous part of any library’s user base, but in order to recognize the full economic diversity of its audience, the homeless must be accepted. This thinking on economic diversity and the homeless still rings true for me today.</p>

                        <p><a href="pdfs/LIBR200_Discussion_Alignment.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on alignment">Touting two-way communication is the focus of my third piece of evidence</a>, also a discussion post from LIBR 200 Information and Society. The subject is aligning with users. The salient aspect for this competency is using various communication mediums to gain an understanding of the needs and wants of library users, and then acquainting those users with programs and services to meet their needs. Not only must diversity be recognized and appropriate services adjusted or created, but also the new services must be shared with those who could benefit from them. Knowing that users are diverse, the recommendation I make in my post is to use as many avenues of communication as possible to reach out to the full breadth of the user base. Comment cards, email surveys, Facebook posts, website contact forms and comments shared with those at the front desk are all viable methods and necessary to ensure all user backgrounds, age ranges, and income levels are given avenues to share their preferences and requirements. This concept of two-way communication is still a valid approach for me, in fact I would say that an open, often instant conversation between library and user is becoming more and more expected with the flowering of participatory social media and the like. Users expect to be able to reach out to the library and express their concerns and needs and to have the library respond with at least acknowledgement if not an immediate solution.</p>

                        <p>A small part of <a href="pdfs/LIBR204_SpecialLibraryGroup1_StrategicPlan.pdf" title="Link to strategic plan">my LIBR 204 Information Organizations and Management strategic plan</a> furnishes the next evidence of my understanding and application of the third competency. In addition to being team coordinator/leader on this group project, I was also responsible for writing 70% of the content. This is a real percentage based on the number of sections I wrote and received either no or very minimal feedback on during group meetings. And, yes, for the majority of these plan sections all team members were initially asked to contribute content. Unfortunately, both of them were overwhelmed with work and other courses and simply did not provide content suggestions. As to specifics of the plan that meet the competency, recognition of diversity was expressed as the first goal of the Vision Statement for this fictional museum library. The Environmental Scan specifically described economic impacts of the 2008 recession. It also highlighted demographic shifts in the general U.S. population as well as specific ones in the library’s audience based on recent census data; the local minority population (composed of Hispanic/Latino, Asian, Pacific Islanders and Black or African peoples) was growing ahead of the national average. The Threats section also comments on the growing minority population and points to the fact that these users are typically not museum goers with the implication that the museum needs to reach to out these users and understand how they would like be engaged by the museum. The plan of action to address the recognized diversity in the community is described in the Operational Initiatives where the first goal of the first initiative to provide adult and child educational programs is focused on determining appropriate and engaging content for minorities in the community. Further, the second goal of the third operational initiative, which is to continue to build the analog collection, again focuses on adjusting services to meet the needs of minority users. The collection growth goals are focused on increasing the number of books and archival materials and ephemera relating to the experience of the local Hispanic/Latino, Asian and Pacific Islander populations. Methods as to how this might be accomplished are detailed. Creating the plan today, I would make at least two improvements related to diversity. The first would be to investigate ways to make the library and archives more accessible to those in lower income brackets. This might be as simple as reducing event ticket prices and fees for copies. The second would be to understand what portion of the user base had accessibility issues that the museum library had not previously understood or responded to. I think I overlooked these two aspects of diversity and focused almost entirely on cultural diversity in the strategic plan.</p>

                        <p>My final evidence for competency three relates to employing accessibility and Universal Design ideas when creating websites and is rather an amalgamation of three separate examples, all with a very similar theme. The first part of the evidence is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_Discussion_UniversalDesign.pdf" title="Link to discussion on universal design">discussion post for LIBR 251 Web Usability</a>. In this post I decry html tutorials that save accessibility discussions for later chapters instead of teaching accessibility from the start. The example I use in the post is the very simple one of adding an alt attribute onto an img element to allow screen readers to read the subject of photos for those with visual impairments. My point here is simply that knowing a library or knowledge organization has a diverse group of users—especially for its website—why not incorporate accessibility features into the website from the beginning. The second part of the evidence comes from my LIBR 240 Information Technology Tools and Applications class. The final project was the creation of a website. I chose to design a site for the Ketchikan Human Society, which is an organization that one of my dear friends volunteers for. (My site was only a design option; it was never implemented by the organization.) In creating this website, I was careful to include at least basic accessibility features, including alt attributes on img elements, descriptive language for text links, verifying that foreground and background colors were legible per <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/" title="Link to Web Content and Accessibility Guidelines">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>, and including text transcriptions or captions for video. In the <a href="pdfs/LIBR240_KTNHumaneSociety_spendingpage.pdf" title="Link to code of LIBR 240 website">pdf of the code for one page of the site</a>, I’ve highlighted alt attributes used to describe images and to describe a chart’s content for those with vision impairments.  Another small example of an accessible feature, completed for my SJSU Student Assistant position, is the inclusion of a full text transcript of an SJSU SLIS intern’s <a href="http://amazon.sjsu.edu/html-pfranks/videos/Red_InternshipExperience.mp4" title="Link to student video">video</a>. In this video, the student is describing her virtual internship experience. The complete audio is available in <a href="http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/sites/default/files/content_pdf/RedCoffey_VirtualInternshipVideo_Transcript.pdf" title = "Link to transcript of student video">text</a> for those with hearing difficulties. These, albeit small, examples illustrate my understanding of the need to recognize diversity in user populations and how that recognition leads to specific changes in virtual services. As far as reevaluating these accessibility features, I would want to do actual user testing with visually or hearing impaired individuals to determine if the accommodations are in fact helpful to them.</p>

                        <p>Based on the above evidence from the discussion posts, strategic plan, and websites, I feel I have demonstrated an understanding of how to discover diversity, why it is so vital to libraries and information centers, and how these organizations can adjust their programs and services to meet the diverse needs of their users.</p>
