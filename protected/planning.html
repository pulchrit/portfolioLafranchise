                        <h2>4. Planning, Management, Marketing, and Advocacy</h2>

                        <p>Planning, management, marketing, and advocacy are all part of a set of management basics that information as well as other professionals need to understand to effectively support an organization in the accomplishment of its mission.
Planning can include large scale, company wide initiatives, like strategic plans, but it can also include smaller departmental or project based plans. The core tenant of planning is fulfilling an organization’s mission by accomplishing its goals (Evans & Ward, 2007, p. 145-146) and, as goals tends to be related to that organization’s users in some manner, a thorough understanding of the user is critical. To quote Bodi and Maier-O’Shea speaking from a collection management planning perspective:  “we are in a user-centered rather than collection-centered world, and the library’s mission is to customize information for its users” (2005, p. 145). This focus on users must be the lodestone, if you will, of all planning initiatives. Fundamentally, there is variability not only in how organizations approach planning, but also in the resulting plans. The main categories (e.g. mission statement, SWOT, goals, objective, strategies, tactics, etc.) are common, but the expression of these categories can vary greatly depending on the organization, the people who make it what it is, and those directly involved in plan development. And, this variability is demonstrated by Ana Pacios as part of her findings from research into long-range and strategic plan content in public and academic libraries.</p>

                        <p>Management encompasses a variety of aspects, including managing people, finances, facilities, and technology. In a real way, management consists of the execution of a sanctioned operational or strategic plan; however, one aspect of management is planning itself. Certainly these two concepts or activities are co-dependent to a degree. From a functional perspective and according to Gulwick and Urwick, management includes planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting (Evans & Ward, 2007, pp. 8-9). Per Evans and Ward “management, at its most basic level, is the process of accomplishing things through people” (2007, p. 5). I would go a small step further to add the idea of tools to this definition, so “accomplishing things through people who use a variety of tools”, as I think this integrates some of the additional complexity involved in management. From a personal perspective of personnel management based on past experience as both a Marketing Communications Manager and as a Project Manager, I strive to be capable of doing the work of each of my employees, or at least understanding what it takes to do that work. I have found that this increases my team’s respect of me and allows me to lead by example. Further, I feel it’s very important to manage each person differently and according to his/her needs to elicit productivity and facilitate happiness. Because of this thinking, the contingency theory that Evans and Ward (2007, p. 30) describe makes the most sense to me, and I think it works best in my experience. Each situation is slightly different than those that came before it. While past experience can and certainly should act as a guide, the unique features of a given situation or characteristics of a certain employee must be considered in making management decisions. This said, I also greatly appreciate the ideas of the composite approach (Evans & Ward, 2007, p. 33-34). Exposure to a wide variety of thinking across multiple disciplines can only be helpful in generating new ideas for dealing with particular people, projects, or situations. And in fact, this idea of accumulating experiences and knowledge from a variety of people, places, industries, and activities is becoming the hallmark of today’s creative/innovative thinking instruction (Popova, 2011), which is, of course, central to effective management today.</p>
                        <p>Marketing can be variously defined and is often most well known through its subcategories or the ‘marketing mix’ (i.e., Product, Price, Promotion, Place). As with planning, at its core is an understanding of the user in order to promote the right product to him/her, at the right price, and in the right place. Al Ries and Jack Trout famously define marketing to be about how the customer perceives a library, company, product, service, etc. I want to highlight two important laws from their book The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, namely the Law of Perception and the Law of the Mind (Ries & Trout, 1994). To quote the authors: “The law of the mind follows from the law of perception. If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then the mind takes precedence” (Ries & Trout, 1994, p. 15). And again: “There is no objective reality. There are no facts. There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the reality “ (1994, p. 19). This last line has been famously quoted through the years, and it speaks to the need to make every attempt to understand one’s customers, what they desire, what they need, and what product or service might fulfill those needs. Marketing doesn’t have much to do with the practical, though the practical is involved, nor with factual evidence, though factual evidence is necessary and appreciated, it has to do with making emotional connections between customers and a brand. And as Alina Wheeler explains, “Branding is about making an emotional connection. People fall in love with brands—they trust them, develop strong loyalties, buy them and believe in their superiority. The brand is shorthand: it stands for something and demonstrates it (2003, p. 2).
Advocacy is about using communication, negotiation, and rhetoric to acquire the support (financial or otherwise) to achieve an institution’s mission. Evans and Ward describe advocacy as lobbying but with a perhaps more civilized connotation (2007, p. 417). There are many levels of advocacy both within an organization and external to it. There is advocacy within a department to implement a new project or staffing reorganization. There is advocacy within an organization to secure sufficient budget allocation for specific projects or departments. And, especially for non-profits like libraries, there is external advocacy with a governmental funding body to secure appropriate financial support to at least maintain and hopefully improve programs and services. Enlisting the support of users of the information organization in these efforts is vital. I think there is a complex relationship between the goals of the library, the wants and needs of users and both groups’ understanding of and reaction to laws, policies and financial decisions. Though it may seem hackneyed, I believe the best way to ensure the vocal support of users is to utilize both old and new technology to enable communication between those users and the library. Once users understand that their librarians listen and react to their needs, they will feel like they are a valuable part of the library and be concerned with its funding and the effects of laws and policies on their experience of the library. Libraries need to engage in promotional and educational activities that explain their goals and services to users as well as how law, policy, and funding changes affect those goals and services.  Advocacy requires individuals who can cultivate genuine relationships with members of the public as well as members of funding agencies. It also requires persuasive communication about the impact of the institution’s programs and services on the public as well as the representatives of the funding agencies.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>As evidence of my understanding of planning, I submit the <a href="pdfs/LIBR204_SpecialLibraryGroup1_StrategicPlan.pdf" title="Link to strategic plan">strategic plan created for LIBR 204 Information Organizations and Management</a>. In addition to being team coordinator/leader on this group project, I was also responsible for writing 70% of the content. This is a real percentage based on the number of sections I wrote and received either no or very minimal feedback on during group meetings. Unfortunately, the other two team members were overwhelmed with work and other courses and simply did not provide content suggestions for the majority of the plan. The three-year strategic plan was created for a fictional museum library that was loosely based on other similar museum libraries in Pasadena, CA and Portland, OR. The major strategic initiative of the plan was the implementation of a digital collection. Additionally, operational initiatives addressed current services as well as the needs and desires of a growing and diversifying user base. With the library’s mission, vision, and values as an overarching guide, the plan was developed starting with an understanding of the internal management team and their roles and responsibilities. Other internal stakeholders who worked outside of the library but for the museum (i.e., the parent institution) were considered as well. Importantly, the goals and desires of external stakeholders, like the library users and board members of the foundation that established the library, were also recognized. An organizational analysis followed that took a detailed look at different user groups (e.g., researchers and schoolchildren), how they used the library, and what they expected from it.  This was followed by a resource analysis that commented on the current state of human resources, technology, funding, and library facilities. Next, the product and services of the library were explained, including a description of the collections (both analog and a fledging digital collection), educational programs for children and adults, and research services for professionals and novices. All of the above provided a clear picture of the present state of the library. A summary of local and global competitors followed. A brief analysis of economic, sociocultural, demographic, and technological factors described the changing state of the environment in which the library existed. The analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats established how well or poorly the library was fairing within its milieu and given its mission. Future plans were then expounded beginning with operational initiatives to open educational programs to an increasingly diverse user base, methods for providing research services, and goals for increasing the scope of the analog collection, especially for minority cultures. Next came strategic initiatives that were focused on how to successfully implement a digital collection. Following a needs assessment that focused on how, if, and why users might utilize a digital collection and what technologies were required to implement one, the question of funding was addressed. Finally, a fairly detailed timeline for the actual creation of the digital collection was specified. The operational and strategic goals functioned to not only uphold but also to expand the library’s mission to share the cultural heritage of the city with the world to enrich the lives, livelihoods, and educational goals of the global community. Writing the plan today, I would make two major adjustments. The first is to add a focus on economic diversity with the intent of providing a practical solution to meet the needs of local users adversely affected by the economic downturn. This might be as simple as adding a lower tier membership or reducing educational program fees. The second is to consider ways in which the digital collection contents can be exposed not only to cultural heritage aggregators like the World Digital Library, but also to search engines generally through the effective use of Dublin Core metadata.</p>

                        <p>Several documents evidence my understanding of management concepts from a variety of perspectives. The first reflects <a href="pdfs/LIBR204_MLafranchise_MgmtPhilosophyEssay.pdf" title="Link to management philosophy essay">my personal views on management</a> described for LIBR 204 Information Organizations and Management. The second is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_Discussion_Management.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on management">discussion post from LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts</a> where I propose a solution to managing technological change in an archive, and the third is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR281_Discussion_Management.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on management">discussion post from LIBR 281 Seminars in Contemporary Issues – Metadata</a> that explains my experiences with and recommendations for managing and participating in collaborative projects. In <a href="pdfs/LIBR204_MLafranchise_MgmtPhilosophyEssay.pdf" title="Link to management philosophy essay">my management philosophy essay</a>, I begin by explaining my corporate background, which entails close to 15 years experience in various marketing communication roles including Marketing Communications Manager and Project Manager. Based on this experience, I was able to clearly describe the type of organization that I prefer working in—basically one that is participatory instead of role restricted and one that espouses a learning culture where mistakes are seen as learning experiences rather than punishable offences. I then move on to explain how I would create such a culture as a manager, and here I provide specific practical steps to encouraging participation and learning from mistakes, like actively requesting the thoughts of employees during departmental meetings and in one on one meetings with individual employees, and encouraging post-mortem analysis after the completion of projects to understand how the process or outcomes could be improved. This is followed by a description of how I would like to be viewed as a manager, and I specifically mention contingency and composite theories of management as approaches that I would implement. I conclude with a discussion of how I would prefer to be managed and, as might be expected, my thoughts mirror the description of how I would myself like to be viewed as a manager. In particular, I value managers who allow for self-direction in tasks, who are not only confident and encouraging in the face of overwhelming workload, but who are also able to prioritize or break that work down into reasonable phases that can be successfully completed. The core tenants described in this paper are equally valid to me today. Moving on to the <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_Discussion_Management.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on management">LIBR 256 post</a>, I explain how I would manage a particular situation as the head of special collections for a university. In the scenario, the university librarian (i.e., my boss) explains that Google wants to add our digital materials to their new online collection. Basically, we have a situation where access to the collection might be enhanced through partnership with a for-profit technology leader. There are, however, issues with the perpetual use requirements that Google has included in their contract. In my answers to the first question posed in the case study, I espouse the contingency theory to learn about the current and particular situation of the archives. Namely, has the audience shrunk to the point where the future of the archives is in question, have funding sources been allocated away from the archives? The goal is to understand the current situation to determine if Google’s offer would prove helpful. I follow with specific questions about what promises Google is making in return for the use of our materials. Could the benefit of exposure outweigh the risks of the exclusive use rights Google is requesting? I suggest that negotiating with Google on terms of the contract should be possible and that the benefits of the increased access Google provides could help the archive to fulfill its mission of providing access to historical materials for the use of researchers around the world. The case study asks a second question about possibly sharing in the revenue Google might be making from our digital materials. My recommendation was to be straightforward in speaking to the Google representative about the possibility of sharing income generated and to have contingency requests in place—such as the possibility of a barter for Adword space for the archive and some quantified promise of the number of links back to the archive’s digital collection by way of the Google collection—should they deny the initial revenue sharing request. The basic idea is to understand the unique aspects of the situation and not be intimidated by Google’s request, but rather negotiate with them to try to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. This thinking still seems sounds to me today, and, in fact, I would push for something more from Google like help with automating the generation of metadata for the archive’s collection. My final evidence of competence in management is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR281_Discussion_Management.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on management">post written for LIBR 281</a> where I explain my experiences as a leader and participant in collaborative teams and detail recommendations for effective collaborative work. I include this as an example of how a manager can get work accomplished through people. Specifically, I highlight the following:

                                <ul>
                                        <li>Invite the appropriate departmental or subject matter experts to contribute to the team, especially if these individuals or the groups they represent will be impacted by the project.</li>
	                                <li>Schedule in buffer time; the project will almost always take longer than anticipated.</li>
	                                <li>If you are the leader, learn to communicate with team members in a way that suits them. You’ll get their best work this way.</li>
	                                <li>Keep meetings short; work happens outside of meetings.</li>
	                                <li>Provide reminders of due dates.</li>
	                                <li>Be thankful and encouraging to those who contribute; talk to those who aren’t to understand why they aren’t contributing.</li>
	                                <li>Lead by example; do what you promised to do within the timeframe promised.</li>
                                </ul>

I still feel these to be sound recommendations for managing collaborative teams today.</p>
                        <p>Evidence of my understanding of marketing comes from two documents. The first is the <a href="pdfs/CommunicationsBrief_Marketing.pdf" title="Link to communications brief">marketing communications plan</a> I produced as the project manager of a product launch at my previous employer. The second is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR204_Discussion_Marketing.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on marketing">post written for LIBR 204 Information Organizations and Management</a>. While it speaks specifically to the promotional aspect of marketing, an understanding of product, price, and place strategies were foundational to the <a href="pdfs/CommunicationsBrief_Marketing.pdf" title="Link to communications brief">promotional plan</a> I created while with my former employer. The Communications Brief, as it was called, outlines the goals and objectives of the launch, the market situation and audience messages (content for these last two was originally provided by the product manager who was launching these ventilation products), key messages, creative strategy, taglines for the products, features/benefits or value propositions of the products, as well as housekeeping information like product codes and trademarks. The largest portion of the brief is devoted to the deliverables of the promotional plan, which have been phased by date of a particular sub-product launch. This section includes all of the basics necessary to produce sales collateral and promotional materials for the product launches including the due date, person responsible for completion, whether translations were required, the print cost and quantity where applicable, and detailed notes to describe the content of each piece. Deliverables covered all of the major promotional categories, including print materials, multi-media, email, websites, give-aways/gifts, photography needs, print and online advertising and media placement, tradeshow presence, social media activities, public relations, and direct mail. The brief was a representation of and a guide to the comprehensive promotional activities surrounding the launch of these ventilation products. There are always improvements to make in promotional strategies for product launches, and the key to understanding what works and what doesn’t is reviewing the results of each activity to judge its effectiveness at reaching a target audience and measuring its response to the calls to action included in the promotional materials. The second piece of evidence of my competence in marketing is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR204_Discussion_Marketing.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on marketing">brief discussion post from LIBR 204</a> wherein I suggest some additional promotional tactics that my local library could have implemented as part of the launch of its new website. While I praise their building of anticipation and launch announcement on Facebook and Twitter, I did see room for additional techniques such as an email announcement to the library’s membership list, a press release announcing the website launch on the local newswire, and the implementation of an online scavenger hunt/contest using the new website as the scavenging grounds to familiarize users with the contents and features of the site itself. These tactics still make sense to me as affordable and effective methods for spreading the word of the website launch to the full breadth of the library’s audience.</p>

                        <p>Finally, my competence of advocacy for an information organization is represented in the <a href="videos/LIBR204_Lafranchise_Advocacy_Video.swf" title="Link to advocacy video">presentation/video</a> I created for LIBR 204 Information Organizations and Management. This presentation explained the value of the strategic initiative outlined in the museum library plan included as evidence of planning experience above. It would be included on the museum’s website and used as ‘slides’ for live presentations that the museum librarian would give to the directors of the foundation (i.e., the funding agency), museum members and volunteers, and in any other venue that might lead to financial or other support for the library’s initiative of creating a globally accessible digital collection. In terms of evaluation, the presentation is reasonably good. I would update the call to action slide to include more specific ways in which people could help (e.g., donate online through the museum’s website, send checks to such and such address, or for members, add an additional amount to your membership renewal fee to specifically support the digital collection initiative).</p>

                        <p>The above, rather lengthy, review of my LIBR 204 strategic plan, my management philosophy essay, the discussion post for LIBR 256 on responding to a possible Google partnership, the discussion post for LIBR 281 on leading collaborative teams, the promotional plan for the ventilation product launch, the discussion post on marketing tactics for LIBR 204, and my advocacy presentation for LIBR 204 all illustrate my understanding of planning, management, marketing, and advocacy and the importance of these management basics for any non-profit information organization or for-profit business.</p>
