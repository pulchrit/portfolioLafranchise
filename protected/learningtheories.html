                        <h2>11. Learning Theories</h2>

                        <p>The bulk of the following description of learning theories comes from the work of Knowles, Holton, and Swanson who “define learning as the process of gaining knowledge and expertise” (2011, Chapter 2, Summary, para. 2).</p>

                        <p>There are many theories of learning, but they tend to fall into two main families: behaviorist/connectionist and cognitive/gestalt.</p>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>Behaviorists want to observe physical stimuli to see what results it produces. “Behaviorism was uniquely American; and mirrored the philosophy of the turn-of-the-century notion that all people could achieve great accomplishments given opportunity (stimulus), individual initiative (response), and fair treatment (rewards)” (Knowles, Holton, & Swanson, 2011, Chapter 3, Summary, para. 1).</li>
                                        <li>Gestalt/organismic theories believe that we respond to a whole pattern of stimuli, not just specific, isolated stimulus. That the environment or our field of perception is vital in providing context for learning. The whole is more impactful than the parts.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p>Another way to look at these divisions is the part/whole models, or elemental and holistic models of Hayne W. Reese and Willis F. Overton, where the elemental are a type of behaviorist/connectionist theory and the holistic are a type of cognitive/gestalt theory.</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>The elemental model “represents the world as a system composed of discrete pieces” (Knowles, Holton, & Swanson, 2011, Chapter 3, The Concept of Part and Whole Models of Development, para. 3).</li>

                                        <ul>
                                                <li>Thorndike’s bond theory of learning is an elemental model—a theory of stimulus, response, and reward. A given stimulus is repeated to produce a desired response, which is then reinforced through reward. Pavlov’s famous experiments fall into this category of learning theory.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                <li>The holistic model “represents the universe as a unitary, interactive, developing organism” (Knowles, Holton, & Swanson, 2011, Chapter 3, The Concept of Part and Whole Models of Development, para. 4) People are active in this worldview, not reactive to external stimuli. Internal motivation is key.</li>

                                        <ul>
                                                <li>Dewey’s functionalism is holistic and emphasizes a child’s desire to solve her/her own problems as the core of learning. There is a motivating factor behind the learning; it’s not just a response to a stimulus.</li>
                                        </ul>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Considering teaching and learning in praxis, I’d like to discuss pedagogy and andragogy with an emphasis on andragogy, as it is most applicable to my future career path. Pedagogy can be considered the teaching of children, while andragogy can be considered the teaching of adults. The reality is that both pedagogical and andragogical methods can be used with both children and adults depending on the situation and the learning style of the students.</p>

                        <p>Pedagogy presupposes a passive learner, a learner who can be indoctrinated in the subject at hand. Pedagogy developed out of the cathedral schools of the Middle Ages where students were specifically instructed what to believe and what to think. They were not encouraged to question or engage in critical thinking, as was the case with the method employed by, for example, Socrates or Confucius who required active and engaged learners. In pedagogy, students are taught according to subjects (e.g., mathematics, chemistry). The instructor is considered omniscient in the subject and conveys information to the students.</p>

                        <p>One of the key differences in andragogy is that adults learn in order to solve problems in their daily lives. It’s not the generic learning of the whole of a subject, but rather a specific learning that they can directly apply for the betterment of themselves or their lives. What is taught must be relevant to adult learners. Adults are active and self-directed learners who have as much experience as their teachers and should be encouraged to contribute from that experience. They are motivated to learn by their needs, interests, and life challenges. They have different learning styles depending on their age and the particular problem they seek to solve through learning. Tied to these traits are three types of adult learners as proposed by Cyril O. Houle:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li>Those who are goal-oriented, that is, they learn based on a need or interest.</li>
                                <li>Those who are activity-oriented, that is, first and foremost, they desire the social contact that comes with the learning experiences.</li>
                                <li>Those who are learning-oriented, that is, they learn for the sake of gaining knowledge itself.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In adult learning, the instructor is considered more of a facilitator, supporter, and resource, someone to share experiences with in order to cooperatively increase knowledge, skills, etc.</p>

                        <p>As for the andragogical model itself, there are six key assumptions that must be understood, or considerations that must be made, when teaching adults.</p>

                        <ol>
                                <li>Adults need to understand the value they will derive from the learning.</li>
                                <li>Adults do not want a teacher dictating to them, they want to be responsible for their own, self-directed learning.</li>
                                <li>Adult’s life experience should be welcomed in the learning environment, and different experience levels should be taken into account by the teacher/facilitator in order to create a safe and supportive learning environment.</li>
                                <li>Adults will learn best when they are ready to learn because the learning will be directly applicable to their daily lives.</li>
                                <li>Adults are focused on learning that is related to solving specific tasks; they aren’t necessarily interested in learning broad subjects like schoolchildren do.</li>
                                <li>Adults are motivated by internal rewards, like self-confidence, enjoyment of life, and job satisfaction rather more than external rewards like grades or salary increases.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Understanding learning theories—both pedagogical and andragogical—is vital to today’s information professionals who are expected to help everyone from toddlers to senior citizens on a daily basis. The learning theories are helpful not only in formal classroom environments, but in the more short-term interactions at the reference desk as well. Instructing or facilitating learning for each group will be most effective when it takes into account how and why these disparate types of students gain knowledge. Andragogy is especially important for me personally, as it is most likely that my audiences will always be goal-oriented adult learners.</p>


                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>The evidence I present to demonstrate my competence in applying learning and teaching theories is the <a href="pdfs/StudentAssistant_SiteSupervisorGuide.pdf" title="Link to site supervisor guide">site supervisor guide</a> to the internship database. I created this guide in my role as Student Assistant for the SJSU SLIS Internship Program. Importantly, in terms of my evidence, is the idea of andragogy’s flexibility: “The andragogical model is a system of elements that can be adopted or adapted in whole or in part. It is not an ideology that must be applied totally and without modification. In fact, an essential feature of andragogy is flexibility” (Knowles, Holton, & Swanson, 2011, Chapter 7, Integrated System or Flexible Assumptions? para. 2).
The site supervisor instructions are provided in their preliminary form. Eventually, they will be available through the internship database itself via the Help menu. I am currently working with the SJSU SLIS team that makes web updates to implement the final form; however, I am not certain it will be ready in time to submit as evidence for my e-Portfolio. Hence, the preliminary document is provided. While this pdf document is not exactly well designed and attractive, it does contain the content and functionality (i.e., hyperlinking) that will be available in the final. Internship site supervisors will come to these instructions seeking specific goal-oriented solutions (e.g., change my password, list my internship as filled, renew my internship for the upcoming semesters, add a contact to my institution). They will find a menu divided into categories (i.e., Create, Edit, View, Delete, Evaluate). Each category will contain links to specific tasks.</p>

                        <p>Viewing the site supervisor guide through the andragogical model that was used to create it, we can observe the following:</p>

                        <ol>
                                <li><em>Adults need to understand the value they will derive from the learning.</em>
In this case, the value of the guide is clear. Site supervisors need to accomplish specific tasks to fulfill their job responsibilities related to finding and hiring interns.</li>

                                <li><em>Adults do not want a teacher dictating to them, they want to be responsible for their own, self-directed learning.</em>
The decision to create a self-service guide for site supervisors was based on this assumption. Rather than forcing site supervisors to contact SLIS faculty supervisors for help, the guide was created to be a learning resource that site supervisors could access at the time of need to immediately find instructions to solve their problems. As one of the hallmarks of andragogy is tailoring learning resources to the manner in which students appreciate being taught, we will maintain contact information for the SLIS faculty supervisors on the Help page. This will allow those learners who find it easier to learn from people, rather than a self-service web page, to easily do so and accomplish their goals.</li>

                                <li><em>Adult’s life experience should be welcomed in the learning environment, and different experience levels should be taken into account by the teacher/facilitator in order to create a safe and supportive learning environment.</em>
The safe, supportive learning environment in this case is the online environment of the Help page and the task options it presents to site supervisors. This may not be intrinsically a safe and supportive learning environment to some, hence, as described above, those who are more comfortable speaking with someone directly to learn how to accomplish tasks will be given the means to contact a SLIS Faculty Supervisor with questions.</li>

                                <li><em>Adults will learn best when they are ready to learn because the learning will be directly applicable to their daily lives.</em>
The site supervisor guide is available right where it’s needed—within the database itself. Further, when site supervisors are ready to add or update their internship listings or need to change their email address, they will be able to come to the Help page and quickly select the instruction set that will be applicable to their immediate needs.</li>

                                <li><em>Adults are focused on learning that is related to solving specific tasks; they aren’t necessarily interested in learning broad subjects like schoolchildren do.</em>
Once again, the site supervisor guide is expressly created to allow site supervisors to solve specific tasks. There is no large instruction book that a site supervisor would be instructed to go through to learn everything there is to know about interacting with the database. There are only the menu categories and specific task instruction links that are directly accessible from the Help page.</li>

                                <li><em>Adults are motivated by internal rewards, like self-confidence, enjoyment of life, and job satisfaction rather more than external rewards like grades or salary increases.</em>
Obviously, there is no real way for SJSU SLIS to reward these site supervisors for their learning outside of the self-confidence and sense of accomplishment they gain from applying the instructions to solve their specific problems. In fact, it’s most likely to be the removal of the problem, rather than any internal reward, that would motivate these site supervisors.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Finally, I would like to briefly comment on the combination of both pedagogical and andragogical tactics implemented in the site supervisor guide. As Knowles, Holton, and Swanson (2011) explain, a modern approach to learning theories applies both teaching methods as required. I believe this is quite apparent in the site supervisor guide where the approach to and the organization of the learning material are based on andragogical assumptions (as described above), but the actual content of the learning materials is quite pedagogical. The individual instructions are how-to guides; they instruct the learner in the proper way to accomplish a specific task in the database. They fundamentally must be pedagogical as the system was designed to work in a specific way, and that requires users to behave in a specific way to make the system work for them. As this is a very recent project and as my supervisor has reviewed the content and functionality and already suggested changes, I don’t believe there are any modifications that I would make as of today. However, as I work with the web team to implement the content in the live database, I know there will be adjustments to make.</p>

                        <p>Though singular, I believe the site supervisor guide I developed for the SJSU SLIS Internship Program’s database to be a comprehensive example of the application of learning theories and andragogical teaching theories that will aid users in finding and using information that helps them fulfill their needs.</p>
