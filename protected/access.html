                        <h2>9. Information Access</h2>

                        <p>As my career pathway is web programming and information architecture, I would like to discuss providing access to information in terms of web usability. With websites, there are no human gatekeepers or guides to information as at a library’s reference desk. Access to the information is through the information itself. There are clearly defined principles for building effective user interfaces that allow websites to become the gatekeepers and guides for the information they contain. There is also a clearly defined process to build effective interfaces. Below, I highlight several principles recommended by Jakob Nielsen and Bruce Tognazzini as well as briefly describe the process for effective interface design.</p>

                        <p>Nielsen’s heuristics are derived from a multitude of user studies. His evidence-based guidelines allow web designers and programmers to create sites that connect users to information quickly and easily. A few example heuristics include:</p>

                                <ul>
                                        <li><em>Aesthetic and minimalist design</em> Designers must strive to show only relevant information that communicates to the user. Extraneous or overwhelming amounts of information displayed on a single page will serve to reduce visibility and understandability of all information on that page. A focus on the information task at hand is key.</li>

                                        <li><em>Recognition rather than recall</em> Ensure user options and actions are visible and apparent. They should never have to remember what to do next, there should always be a clear path to the information they need.</li>

                                        <li><em>Consistency and standards</em> Designers must maintain consistency within each site as well as maintain consistency with user expectations based on general design and functionality standards. Doing so allows users to easily learn how to navigate or manipulate an interface and apply that learning to new pages and new sites.</li>

                                        <li><em>Match between system and the real world</em> Users shouldn’t have to learn an entirely new vocabulary to understand and access a website, the language and information presented to them should be tailored to their experience and understanding.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p>Bruce Tognazzini’s interaction design principles are intended to guide designers in creative effective interfaces. “Effective interfaces are visually apparent and forgiving, instilling in their users a sense of control. Users quickly see the breadth of their options, grasp how to achieve their goals, and can settle down to do their work” (Tognazzini, 2014, Introduction, para. 1). Several of his principles are related below.</p>

                                <ul>
                                        <li><em>Anticipation</em> Similar to Nielsen’s Recognition and Recall, the anticipation principle exhorts designers to make all information, instructions, and steps necessary to complete and action or find data obvious and apparent. Further, designers need to predict what cues users require, and user testing prior to launch of a site or software product is vital in informing designers of these user needs.</li>

                                        <li><em>Color</em> Using colors to differentiate between information types or actions is important in interface design, but the designer must also ensure that colorblind users are given telltales other than color as signposts for effective interaction.</li>


                                        <li><em>Consistency with user expectation</em> Regardless of how new or seemingly simple a revised interaction is, if users don’t understand it, if it is counter to their expectations of how web pages works, then they will not use it, or at least they will find it difficult to use. When interaction is inconsistent with user expectations a barrier is erected between the user and the information they are seeking.</li>

                                        <li><em>Discoverability</em> Tognazzini expresses it best: “If the user cannot find it, it does not exist” (2014, Discoverability, principle 3). This principle sounds simple and obvious, but designers must ensure that they aren’t being too clever with layout and, in an attempt to keep things superficially simple, hide functionality or menu options. Users won’t spend time searching; they expect to be shown where and how to access the information they desire.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p>Finally, I’d like to discuss the process for building effective interfaces. The first step (for existing websites) is evaluation based on the heuristics and principles described above. From there designers select options from tried-and-true design patterns to alleviate the issues revealed during the evaluation step. The final step involves creating a prototype and testing that prototype with actual users. User feedback is immediately incorporated into the prototype and retested to determine if the changes were effective. This process is iterated until an acceptable and functional design is derived—one that is proven effective by actual users.</p>

                        <p>Understanding how to build usable interfaces is a key skill for LIS professionals. Today, users expect to be able to go to a website to find information when they need it. They don’t always have the time or inclination to stop by a reference desk or email/chat with a reference librarian. One of the main responsibilities of information professionals is to enable access to the information that users require even when they aren’t being asked directly by a user. Building useable websites with effective interfaces is one way to ensure a library or information center is constantly providing patrons with effective self-service options.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>My evidence for this competency comes from a series of assignments completed for LIBR 251 Web Usability and applying the evaluation, design, and implementation process to improve King Library’s LOTSS tutorial. LOTSS stands for the Library Online Tutorial for SLIS Students and is intended to introduce students to online library resources. (Incidentally, I see that the tutorial has been updated since I took this course, hence screen shots and my evaluation reference the prior version.)</p>

                        <p>The first piece of evidence for this competency is my <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_LOTSS_Evaluation.pdf" title="Link to LOTSS evaluation">evaluation of the LOTSS site</a>. For this assignment, we were tasked with applying usability principles to the site to determine where improvements were required. While I submitted only three heuristics with examples of how the LOTSS site violates them, I found and described five more violated principles that are included in the pdf submitted here.  The first issue noted is a lack of accommodation for those with colorblindness on the login and Module 1 homepage. For colorblind users, the important directions won’t be highlighted in red or green. They will look like all of the other copy on the page and since users tend to understand what to do with a login box, they will quite possibly skip over the important notes, assuming them to be a superfluous introduction. I noted several consistency issues as well. The homepage does not match user expectations for what a homepage typically looks like and offers in terms of information options. There is no prominent menu bar offering links. The subheads that do appear at the top of the page are not links. Actual links are somewhat hidden and appear at the far right and at the end of each paragraph of text. Equally, the links themselves are inconsistently formatted. Other concerns are with the lack of state tracking, protecting of users work, and error prevention in the Lingometer quiz. I explain how I was automatically logged out after a period of 10 or so minutes, but was never notified of this by the site. Instead, I answered the rest of the quiz questions only to receive a confusing error at the end, which ultimately resulted in the need to retake the entire quiz. These issues with the LOTSS site prevent users from easily and efficiently accessing information that is, ironically, intended to educate them. The poor usability of the site impedes information access. If students were not required to complete this tutorial as part of LIBR 203, my assumption is that the vast majority would have abandoned it prior to completion out of frustration. I stand by this evaluation today.</p>

                        <p><a href="pdfs/LIBR251_LOTSS_design.pdf" title="Link to LOTSS design">Redesigns that correct some of the usability principle violations</a> serve as my next evidence. I provided designs to alleviate the issues with consistency and lack of accommodation for the colorblind. In making these changes other usability issues were alleviated as well. Changes were based on design patterns provided by Jenifer Tidwell (2011). (To clarify, these are not look/feel designs; they are functional designs, for example, the shades of gray and black are not a final color scheme.) The first page of the pdf shows a revamped homepage with global navigation links at the top and a clear entry point in the center where users can either register or sign in. The sign-in tools pattern groups utilities at the top right of the screen. Colorblindness issues are alleviated through the emphasizing small items pattern, where emphasis is provided by more than simply color differences. Further, responsive disclosure is used to minimize clutter, but provide exactly what the user needs when they need it (i.e., hovering over Register instantly opens the form where they enter their information). Input prompts or smart defaults are used in form fields to direct users in appropriate content to enter and a prominent Done button ensures they know how to complete the task. The second page of the pdf illustrates design patterns to alleviate consistency issues and make the module pages more user-friendly. The visual framework of main navigation, utility links, and logo placement is carried over from the homepage. A sequence map not only guides the user through the tutorial, but it gives them instant awareness of how much farther they have to go to complete it. Tool tips are provided on mouse hover to explain the module steps and the availability of each step. A two-panel selector pattern has been employed to organize the center screen, and simple, but powerful locator additions like page numbers have been included. On the question/answer pages, the layout pattern changes to center stage to prevent user distraction and increase focus on the task at hand. Instant feedback is provided once answers are submitted. All of these changes result in a more usable interface, one that guides users through the process of accessing the information they need. In my opinion, this was a good first iteration of a possible redesign of the LOTSS site. (Incidentally, the professor asked to use this piece as an example for future classes.)</p>

                        <p>My third piece of evidence is from the third step in the process: implementation. Implementation included building a non-web based prototype of several pages and working with actual users to test the proposed functionality, iterate based on their feedback, test again and iterate until a functional design was proven effective in guiding users to the information they required. The evidence is actually the <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_Lafranchise_presentation.pdf" title="Link to LOTSS implementation">summary presentation of this implementation process</a>. Users were given two tasks to complete: register or sign-in and take a quiz. As shown on slide two, three prototypes were created over two rounds of testing. The first prototype begins with the design described in my previous piece of evidence. Changes to this design are entirely based on feedback from the testers. Usability principles and design patterns are adjusted based on actual user feedback, highlighting the difference between standards and real-world application of those standards. The resulting website is more simplified and focused on user information needs. Eliciting feedback and making corresponding changes is the only way to ensure that a site functions as users expect it to. It is the only way to know that the site provides users access to the information they require. As I only completed two rounds of testing on two limited portions of the website, my assumption is that many more adjustments would be required to execute a full redesign of the LOTSS site. I am, however, happy with the outcome of this limited implementation.</p>

                        <p>The evaluation, design, and implementation phases employed in the partial redesign of the LOTSS site demonstrate my understanding of the principles and techniques of connecting individuals and groups to the information they need. As explained in the introduction, I have chosen to look at this competency from a self-service perspective with users accessing websites on their own, where the website itself is the only intermediary. This makes web usability principles vital because they enable information professionals to build sites that efficiently guide users to the information that will help fulfill their needs.</p>
