                        <h2>7. Organizing Information</h2>

                        <p>Information is data assembled in an organized way. The organization enables a user to gain relevant knowledge about a given topic. This new knowledge should spark associations with existing knowledge and experience and can result in insights from the banal (e.g., how to bake a cake) to the inspiring (e.g., cures for diseases). I agree with Rowley and Hartley (2008, p. 5) and Meadow, Boyce, Kraft, and Berry (2007, p. 1) that information is a slippery term to define. I do, however, believe that it is best understood in terms of both potential and realized interaction with it, and to interact with it a user must be able to access it. Information retrieval, a fundamental task of LIS professionals, is about organizing data, information, and knowledge and making it accessible to those who need to find and use it. “Resources of all kinds, irrespective of their source, need organizing so that their contents can be retrieved when required” (Rowley & Hartley, 2008, p. 4). As Morville explains, “information is about communication” (2005, p. 46), and, as the world generates more and more information, the need to make this information easily accessible and effectively retrievable is vital to one’s ability to share ideas and grow (however that is defined) as a global community. How concepts of information retrieval are applied changes over time and with technological innovations; these innovations in turn engender changes in the way information is organized and accessed. Today, “we invent new principles of organization that make sense in a world of knowledge freed from physical constraints” (Weinberger, 2007, p. 7). While the proliferation of data that the Internet enables is wonderful, it is awfully overwhelming at the same time. As Rubin succinctly states, “access to great amounts of information . . . does not necessarily mean that people get the right information” (2010, p. 16).</p>

                        <p>The accessibility differences between physical and virtual environments along with the proliferation of data on the web emphasize a main distinction in information organization and standards of classification: enumerative versus faceted classification. A single organizing principle is used in enumerative classification schemes; they are “descriptive and predictive” (Kwasnik, 1992, p. 72). The creator of the scheme already knows how he/she wants to relate the data to each other and knows how he/she wants to relate that information to the end user. The information pattern is imposed; new connections aren’t facilitated. Enumerative schemes allow for controlled, consistent data organization from a single perspective and are often hierarchical or at least imply hierarchical relationships (regardless of whether they actually exist, Rowley & Hartley, 2008, p. 177). They allow for comparison based on one trait even though there are other traits that could be compared. (Kwasnik, 1992, p. 70; Rowley & Hartley, 2008, p. 177). They don’t easily allow for growth or changes in knowledge. They necessitate mutual exclusivity—there is only one location for each bit of data (Kwasnik, 1992, p. 70; Weinberger, 2007, p. 70). And here we see their value in physical information environments, where a single book can only be physically located in one shelf location. In faceted schemes the organizing principle is flexible. Data is grouped into facets that can be related to other data in a variety of ways thus allowing the user to find their own patterns in the data. Faceted schemes encourage investigation and allow for a multiplicity of perspectives. They recognize “there is no one way to view the world” (Kwasnik, 1992, p. 72), and allow for data/information to be analyzed and resynthesized into a useful and communicative body of knowledge. They allow for indefinite growth, as the data itself requires. Finally, they enable data to be classed in more than one place thus allowing it to be related to other data in many ways and resulting in new patterns (Weinberger, 2007, p. 83), which makes them ideal for digital environments, where a digital book can be fall into different classes and be retrieved by any one of those classes. Further, faceted schemes don’t have to be dictated by information professionals, they can be informal, casual creations or folksonomies built up by the aggregation of tags from thousands or millions of users—a very participatory, post-modern method of information organization. “A big pile of miscellaneous information contains relationships beyond reckoning. . . . that’s why it’s so powerful to let users mix it up for themselves” (Weinberger, 2007, p. 105).</p>

                        <p>From classification schemes to cataloging standards to metadata schema to web design principles, there are myriad formally defined methods by which information can be organized. The use of a particular method is dependent on those doing the organizing, their users, and the field in which they operate—all of which dictate particular aspects of the information that are important and therefore require emphasis through the organizational method.</p>

                        <p>I’d like to include a final comment about general information organization (i.e., not tied to a formal standard of classification) related to prototype theory. Personally, I believe prototype theory makes the most sense. It recognizes the ambiguity of language, but doesn’t see that ambiguity as a barrier. It is simply a characteristic of the human condition, and, as I described in my Communication competency, an instance where the map is not the territory, and this seeming disconnect is nonetheless acceptable. As Weinberger explains when discussing Eleanor Rosch’s prototype theory, “we can know what something means even if it can’t be clearly defined and even if its boundaries can not be sharply drawn. Rosch realized that concepts can be clear without having clear definitions if they’re organized around undisputed examples, or prototypes” (2007, p. 185).</p>

                        <p>Organizing information is simply fundamental to the LIS profession. Recognizing that the need for a way to organize the world—thereby making knowledge accessible—is fundamental to humans, and, moreover, that there is an evolutionarily engrained need for this organization and its dissemination (Wright, 2007) enables LIS professionals to provide users with the information they require. And, again, it is by understanding particular users that LIS professionals can employ effective organizational schemes that will make sense to those users and enable easy access to needed information.</p>


                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>My first piece of evidence for this competency is my <a href="pdfs/LIBR202_MetadataEssay.pdf" title="Link to LIBR 202 metadata essay">essay on metadata</a> from LIBR 202 Information Retrieval. I feel this essay provides a sound overview of metadata, or data about data, and how it is related to organizing information in virtual and physical environments whether through formal standards or informal, accretive, and user-generated systems. I began by describing the overwhelming wealth of metadata available today and metadata’s value in organizing this information and making it accessible to users. I then briefly described traditional LIS metadata of the past and provide today’s interpretation through the description of four fundamental categories (i.e., descriptive, structural, administrative, and use metadata). This is followed by a discussion of who controls the creation of metadata—information professionals or information users—and the controlled, top-down vocabularies versus the uncontrolled, bottom-up folksonomies that each group, respectively, employs. I concluded this section with the simple idea that the two methods for organizing information are not mutually exclusive; rather they can be combined for the benefit of the user. In the next section, I briefly comment on the fact that many, many metadata schemas exist and conclude that they are all worthwhile, but need to be managed to ensure proper use depending on the information environment and user needs. Finally, I concluded the essay with brief mention of the possible future paths for metadata, including: combining top-down with bottom-up classification, as exemplified by some museum sites where users are encouraged to enter their own tags for the digital instantiations of art objects; the concept of Linked Open Data to facilitate the use of multiple information organization tactics and standards; and, the proposal of Jason Bengston to apply the self-organizing behavior witnessed in complex systems to metadata allowing the somewhat automatic combination of controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies for classification. There is one aspect of this metadata discussion where my thinking is a bit different today. I actually believe that some reduction in the number of metadata schemes might be helpful in providing general web access to information across multiple resource categories. (In fact, my final assignment for LIBR 281 Seminars in Contemporary Issues – Metadata was an attempt to prove qualified Dublin Core up to this task, and I think I was successful in showing the scheme to be effective and flexible for general web discovery of materials ranging from education resources to art objects. However, additional detailed schemes should continue to be available to and utilized by experts in those fields who require the breadth or specificity of tailored metadata to retrieve the information they require.</p>

                        <p>My next piece of evidence is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR202_Discussion_FutureofInfo.pdf" title="Link to LIBR 202 Discussion">discussion post</a> for LIBR 202 Information Retrieval. In the first part of this post I commented on a video called “Information R/evolution” produced by Michael Wesch and regarding information organization in today’s web environment. I explained that Wesch was compelling in his argument that the web alleviated the need for traditional information organization according to accepted standards with controlled vocabulary and hierarchies of categorization. He demonstrated throughout the video the ability to navigate the web by hyperlink and tag alone—that this flat layer of information was accessible through the tags and the links and did not require formal categorization. It was up to the users (also and importantly creators in their own right) to search for, select, and decide upon the relevance and trustworthiness of the information they discover. I then related Wesch’s statements to Morville’s insights on old organizational metaphors and his calls for web designers to find new metaphors while cautioning that navigation metaphors shouldn’t ignore the millennia of evolution resulting in our ability to find our way in a physical world through our senses, but rather should acknowledge and enable the use of our senses in the digital realm. With this piece of evidence, we see different ways of thinking about information organization guidelines, but all with the end of making that information accessible to users. My comments on Wesch’s video still feel valid to me today.</p>

                        <p>My final evidence for this information organization competency is the <a href="ktn/index.php" title="Link to Ketchikan Humane Society website">final project/website</a> I created for LIBR 240 Information Technology Tools and Applications. The site was a sample design created for the Ketchikan Humane Society. Specifically, I’d like to discuss the information architecture of the site. In terms of a design pattern for information architecture (i.e., a standard for information organization), the website comes closest to Feature, Search, and Browse, though no search function is enabled on the site (Tidwell, 2011, pp. 30-33). The central portion of the screen is the feature area and contains the main content for that page. A sidebar section to the right contains auxiliary information that is either related to the main content or highlighting an important bit of information, such as the Pet of the Week. The main navigation for browsing appears at the top of page, and is an example of classification that does not rely on a controlled vocabulary found in a traditional LIS environment. The navigation terms and categories selected are based on their ability to communicate to this site’s users and aide them in finding the content that will meet their information need. Based on an analysis of basic page view data, it was determined that visitors to the site are interested in one of three things: adopting a pet, helping the humane society, or learning more about the humane society. Therefore, Adopt, Help and About us were chosen as the main information categories. As this top level hierarchy was so simple, I decided that couching subcategories within drop down or other concealed menus was more detrimental to users’ information search than the small bit of extra space those subcategories took up in the site header. Hence, I revealed all subcategories in the header (e.g., Dogs, Cats, Exotics appear directly below Adopt) in a variation on the design pattern of Fat Menus (Tidwell, 2011, pp. 106-109). Users will hopefully be able to access the content that interests them in a single click. There are other information organization tactics applied on this site, and I’d like to briefly mention one related to visual aids for quantitative information displays in the style of Edward Tufte (1997, 2001), that is, use graphics to enhance data displays. Examples are seen in the Animals Rescued section of the home page and on the Spending page. In both cases the data is visualized to help visitors digest it more quickly than a text list of figures would allow. For example on the home page, the number of dogs rescued appears in the silhouette of a dog, instantly making the connection between the number and the concept of dogs. The spending page includes a more traditional data visualization in the form of a pie chart illustrating how the humane society spends its money. The key data point for visitors is that 95% of donations are spent on the animals while only 5% are spent on administration. This is clearly illustrated in the pie chart and the image of the size of pie slices will tend to remain in visitors’ minds even when the particulars of the percentages might fade. While there are a few look and feel design changes I would make to this site today, I feel that the information organization is strong and enables easy access to the content users are seeking.</p>

                        <p>The above metadata essay from LIBR 202, discussion post from LIBR 202 and website from LIBR 240 all illustrate my understanding of the principles and standards of organizing information in physical and virtual environments, how principles differ depending on the environment, and how they aid in making information accessible to those seeking it.</p>
