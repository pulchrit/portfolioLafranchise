                        <h2>8. Information and Communication Technologies</h2>

                        <p>Libraries and other information organizations have historically been at the leading edge of adopting new information and communication technologies (e.g., early adoption of microfiche, online searching, CD/DVD storage, etc.), and they continue to be today with the use of websites, social media and social tagging, blogs, apps and the like. While websites provide information, they can also encourage interaction with patrons such as patron reviews and recommendations of books and movies. Social media sites are expressly for interaction with users and can serve as effective tools to provide, among other things, reference services. Many have also integrated the latest technology into the services they offer, for example, makerspaces with 3D printers, computing/media centers, and RFID tags for loaned books. Makerspaces and computing centers allow libraries to expand beyond the traditional role of book lender and community center, fulfilling a modern-day need for technology-enhanced social spaces. Other libraries are using the latest communication and information technologies to improve services, for example, using games and gamification in instructional programs or adding Kindles and tablets to their available tools.</p>

                        <p>The ever-burgeoning world of technology can be very difficult to keep up with. I appreciate the help provided by the New Media Consortium and specifically their NMC Horizon Reports (New Media Consortium [NMC], n.d.). While these reports are typically created for K-12 education, higher education, and museums, the content they contain can easily be applied in libraries and other information organizations. The reports are created by an international panel of experts in education, technology, and other fields based on their knowledge, experiences, and the latest research. They provide a summary of technologies that may be implemented in the near, mid, and long term, and provide examples of current day applications of these technologies. I think these reports provide helpful overviews as well as actionable recommendations for any library or information organization.</p>

                        <p>Not only does employing the latest in communication and information technologies improve LIS services and increase contact with new and younger audiences, but they help maintain non-profit libraries and information centers as current and vibrant contributors to their communities, which helps ensure funding and ultimately the survival of these institutions over time. As the competency wording suggests, this is not just about adopting today’s technologies, but looking ahead to emerging ones that will need to be incorporated not only to stay current, but also for the real benefit they can provide to LIS institutions and their patrons.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>An evaluation of the <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_InternshipBlog_Evaluation.pdf" title="Link to technology evaluation example">SJSU SLIS internship blog</a>, completed for LIBR 251 Web Usability, serves as my first piece of evidence for this competency. Blogs are informal information sharing sites that provide regular content updates on a given subject area and allow readers of that content to interact directly through comments. All posts uploaded to the blog are archived and searchable through the interface. Posts are also formally organized into browsable categories and informally tagged for retrieval as well. This usability evaluation was accomplished through three phases. The first was a formal evaluation of the blog against usability heuristics defined by Jakob Nielsen and Bruce Tognazzini. Nine specific areas for improvement were noted during the evaluation phase. Evaluation was followed by the functional design stage and, after a review of blog reader characteristics, five design patterns, as defined by Jenifer Tidwell, were selected to increase the ability of users to find recent, popular, and archived content and to share that content. Implementation was the final stage and involved user testing of the functionality through mock-ups. Two users were asked to complete specific tasks and provide their feedback and answer questions during testing. Two rounds of testing were undertaken with improvements made to the design after each round. This iterative approach allowed for more confidence in design pattern selection and in the methods selected to improve the deficiencies noted by the testers. This three-step process helps the user interface designer to understand that his/her goal is not the design itself, but the users’ ability to interact with that design to effectively and efficiently address their needs. I stand by this evaluation today, and, if time allows in what remains of the Student Research Assistant assignment, have received permission to make some of these enhancements to not only the SLIS Internship Blog, but also the SLIS Virtual Internship Blog.</p>

                        <p>Examples of using the latest information and communication technologies are derived from my SJSU SLIS Student Research Assistant work and include blog content creation, virtual event management, and Javascript/JQuery coding to enhance a SLIS internship web page. I am responsible for creating content for the <a href="http://slisapps.sjsu.edu/blogs/wp/slis-internship/" title="Link to SLIS Internship Blog">Internship Blog</a> and the <a href="http://slisapps.sjsu.edu/blogs/wp/virtual-internship/" title="Link to SLIS Virtual Internship Blog">Virtual Internship Blog</a>. The goal is to provide current and prospective interns with the information and advice they need to complete an internship successfully. Posts include a wide variety of topics ranging from creative thinking to time management to productivity advice, all of which have been gleaned from the vast amount of information available online. With each post an attempt is made to show how the information is specifically applicable to SLIS internships. Additional posts are gathered from LIBR 294 discussion content and result in tips from interns or spotlights of interns’ experiences. The use of this particular communication technology provides an informal and regularly updated source of information for SLIS students thinking of completing LIBR or MARA 294. It’s another way to bring them the information they need in a form other than a static website. Comments from readers are also welcomed, though rarely employed. Hence, the two-way communication that might be expected say of Facebook or other social media sites is not really occurring. In terms of improving the blogs’ content, I believe the first step is to understand who is reading them and why. Some of this information could be accessed through the user statistics gathered for the blogs. While the faculty supervisor overseeing the blogs, has requested such data, the team that would provide it has other priority projects ahead of this request. The <a href="http://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/jwsdetect/playback.jnlp?psid=2013-11-12.1852.M.109ED2E7289E20981E21F357174DB2.vcr&sid=2011274" title="Link to Collaborate recording of Site Supervisor Panel">Internship Site Supervisor Panels</a> are the next evidence of my ability to use new communication technologies. This series of virtual presentations occurs once a semester and enables internship site supervisors to showcase their opportunities for the SLIS student audience. While the idea for the site supervisor panels was that of the professor who manages the SLIS Internship Program, I have been responsible for managing the planning and logistics of the events. This includes many tasks, such as writing and sending email invitations to all site supervisors, scheduling interested supervisors in time slots on preferred days, alerting site supervisors when all presentation spaces have been filled, providing additional details about the sessions including Power Point templates for the supervisors’ presentations, reviewing those presentations and preparing them for display during the panel sessions, co-hosting the collaborative virtual sessions themselves, as well as inviting students to the sessions, and posting recording links of those sessions for students on the SLIS website. These panel programs require that I harness the power of email, presentation software, virtual collaboration software, and web content to plan and execute virtual events. Though I’m not certain exactly how to accomplish this, I would like to increase the number of students who attend the live events. The invitation and reminder emails that are sent to all SLIS student through SLIS Alerts don’t seem to be bringing in a very large audience. However, given that SJSU SLIS is fully online and mostly asynchronous and that most students work during the day and tackle their course work at night, perhaps the recording links of these sessions are used by more students than can attend the live events. Again, the faculty supervisor who manages the SLIS Internship Program has asked for information on number of clicks on the recording links, however this is not currently a priority project for the team who manages the SLIS website. The final evidence of my ability to utilize the latest information and communication technologies comes from the Javascript/JQuery code I wrote for the <a href="http://slisapps.sjsu.edu/checklists/internships/virtual-quiz.php" title="Link to Javascript/JQuery example">Who Should Apply for a Virtual Internship? page</a> on the SLIS website. Originally, this page included a list of questions students were supposed to answer on their own and then decide if their answers qualified them for a virtual internship. I chose to make the question list a bit more interactive (and hopefully a bit more engaging) by writing JQuery that will track a student’s responses to each question and deliver a recommendation as to whether that student is well suited for a virtual internship. Though this is a very simple technology application that makes accessing information simple, easy and relatively entertaining, it demonstrates how I harnessed information technology to enhance a LIS related website for the benefit of the user. Looking back at this web page, I’d improve it by trying to categorize the questions to a degree. I feel that the rather long list of questions might seem a bit overwhelming to students.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I’d like to provide evidence of my ability to identify emerging technologies that could benefit LIS organizations. The section entitled <a href="pdfs/LIBR200_Lafranchise_FinalPaper.pdf" title="Link to emerging technology example">“Beyond Access: Enhancing Usability” from my LIBR 200 Information and Society research paper</a> discusses several emerging technologies and how they could be fruitfully employed in cultural heritage organizations. First, I reviewed Augmented Reality (AR), smart objects and the Internet of Things as tools that could be incorporated into physical collections. For example, AR could be used to display meta-data related to an archival object or used to enhance wayfinding in the stacks. Smart objects could be used to embed metadata into an artifact (or its container) or track environmental conditions for that artifact with the Internet of Things transferring this information to interested or responsible parties. I then discussed some possible applications for gesture-based computing and 3D scanning in digital archives, including using touch tables and Sixth-Sense technologies to interact with very high-resolution 3D scans of objects—in a way mimicking but enhancing the experience of a physical archive. While I stand by the ideas and potential applications described in this section of the paper, with technology enhancement occurring exponentially, it would make sense to reevaluate the current state of each technology and see how that changes or improves its application in LIS environments.</p>

                        <p>My evaluation of the SLIS internship blog for LIBR 251, the several examples of using technology for my Student Research Assistant position, and the discussion of emerging technologies in my LIBR 200 research paper demonstrate my ability to evaluation, use, and identify current and emerging information and communication technologies for the benefit of LIS and related organizations.</p>
