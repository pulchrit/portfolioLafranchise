    <h1>Adopt a Dog</h1> 
        <p>Our dogs are fostered in homes so they have a chance to socialize and adjust to the pace of a normal household. The adoption fee is $50 for dogs that were altered prior to rescue and $150 for dogs altered by KHS.</p> 
 
        <p>If you are interested in adopting, <a href="pdfs/dog_adoptionapplication.pdf" title="Adoption application">download the application</a>, and then <a href="contact.php" title="Contact us">give us a call</a>.</p>
