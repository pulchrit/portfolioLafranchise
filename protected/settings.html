                        <h2>2. Organizational Settings</h2>

                        <p>Though organizational settings can vary widely, they all have a fundamental similarity in that the LIS professionals working in them are responsible for connecting users to information. A variety of activities allow for that connection, including reference services, educational assistance, social meeting spaces, research rooms, exhibitions, and websites. In the discussion below, I compare public libraries, archives, and for-profit businesses based on differences in their funding sources, audiences, and collections.</p>

                        <p></p>The public library’s mission is broad and encompasses meeting the educational, entertainment, and information needs of its community (Rubin, 2010). The bulk of funding is dependent on local, state, and national government budgets with voter approved tax support coming from various types of taxes. Public libraries can also accept monetary donations as well as donations of books and supplies from the local populace. Typically, these donations are managed through either a library foundation or a friends of the library program. The audience of a public library is as broad and diverse as the community it serves. That can include all age levels, a variety of ethnicities, and children and adults with disabilities. It is up to the library administration and planners, as discussed in competency 4 Planning and Management, to learn about the particular needs of their audience and allocate budget to the programs and services that their patrons require. Collections, programs, and services of public libraries reflect the diverse information, education, and recreation needs of their users. A large immigrant population might be best served by English as a second language classes or story times given in minority group languages. Books, both physical and digital, should be in a language and on topics of interest to users. Computing centers may be small or large and may contain gaming sections or sections reserved for Internet access. Perhaps a large teen center is required, or a large children’s literature section. Again, all is dependent on the needs of users and the ability of the library to fund the disparate programs, services, and collection needs.</p>

                        <p>An archives’ mission is much narrower than a public library and revolves around preserving unique, unpublished materials and providing access to these materials through proper organization and description (Hunter, 2003). Funding sources can vary significantly depending on the archives’ origin. There are national, state, and city archives which would be funded through those government budgets. There are archives that are part of a public library or academic library, and their funding would fall under the auspices of their parent institutions’ budgets. There are small archives that are founded and supported by local family foundations or historical foundations. Monetary donations can also make up a large part of an archives’ funding. Many for-profit and non-profit businesses also manage archives, and funding occurs as part of the larger organizational budget. Users of archives are typically novice and professional researchers with an interest in the collection focus of the archives. These might be local, national, or international users depending on the collections housed in the archives and its outreach or promotional activities. In business archives, users would tend to be employees first and foremost with outside historians and researchers as a secondary audience. The general public may also make up part of the audience, especially if the archives produces educational programs or exhibits for adults and children. (Some of these programs may well be income generators for the archives.) As briefly mentioned above, archives collections are comprised of mostly unique and unpublished materials, which have either been donated to or purchased by the archives. Personal papers, manuscripts, business or government records, photographs, and video/film may be included. The themes of an archives’ collection are dependent upon decisions made by its founders and administrators and typically match the focus of the institution’s mission. They could cover anything from city records to a senator’s personal and professional papers to the records of a student activist group to a company’s financial statements.</p>

                        <p>For-profit businesses come in many shapes and sizes from small entrepreneurial firms to large corporate multi-nationals. LIS professionals might take on a variety of roles in these environments, from the previously mentioned archival one to a database administrator, knowledge manager, or web programmer. Typically, the LIS professional will be part of a department with an allocated budget and responsible for requesting funds sufficient to support his/her initiatives. Audiences again are varied. They might be internal ones in the case of the database administrator, or they might be external ones in the case of the company website programmer. Depending on the exact role, ‘collection’ might not be the correct way to describe the information a LIS professional is responsible for gathering, organizing, and making accessible. However, as just described, the fundamental functions are the same whether it’s a collection of books, a database of products, or the contents of a website.</p>

                        <p>Understanding these organizational differences will allow LIS professionals to feel comfortable and contribute in multiple work environments. They understand the fundamentals of information organization, retrieval, and access and can apply them to suit the needs of each particular environment.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>My evidence for this competency is all rather more tangential than direct discussions of various organizational settings. The first piece is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR200_discussion_budgets.pdf" title="Link to discussion on budgets">discussion post from LIBR 200 Information and Society</a> on the need to be creative with budgets after the 2008 economic downturn. In the post, I commented on initiatives of two public libraries. The Brooklyn Public library created a campaign to both elicit donations from the local community and encourage users to send postcards to elected officials requesting the restoration of library funds. I believe this initiative shows the power of a large and diverse user base and is a very intelligent way for a public library to manage its funding issues, especially in lean times. The Okaloosa Public Library took a different tack in response to its budget restrictions. It reached out to its audience through Facebook and Twitter—basically no cost options that doubled as new avenues to provide service and also to advertise. This is a very creative solution to budget cuts. The library continued to provide the services that it was able to, engaged its audience, and certainly built goodwill with that audience for the next time a vote regarding library funding was on the ballot. I stand by my comments regarding how these public libraries managed funding issues in the face of budget cuts.</p>

                        <p>My next piece of evidence is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR204_discussion_joblistings.pdf" title="Link to discussion on job listings">discussion post from LIBR 204 Information Organizations and Management</a>. In this post, I compared three LIS job postings based on information provided about the organization, the job, and the job requirements. Two listings were from academic libraries and one from a public library. I mentioned the differences in how the organizations described themselves. One of the academic libraries is the largest employer in the area, and so little organization information was included in the ad. My assumption was that the person who wrote the description felt the university to be well known enough not to require extensive explanation to a local audience. The other academic library included more organization information and compared itself to other similar universities. The public library included not only a description of the organization, but also a description of the city, leading me to believe hiring managers were looking outside of the local population. I then noted the similarities in the academic library positions, as both were upper level faculty positions with multiple direct reports, responsibility for strategic planning, and requirements for ongoing research programs. Differences between the academic and public library requirements were explained. In particular, it was noted that the public library was very explicit about its hiring policy and procedure. I assumed this was due to the fact that it was a public institution and therefore had strict requirements about providing equal opportunity to all candidates and transparency in its hiring practices. I believe this post provided an adequate comparison of academic and public libraries through the similarities and differences obvious in their job listings.</p>

                        <p>My final evidence comes from a <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_discussion_archivesfuture.pdf" title="Link to discussion on future of archvies">LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts post</a> on the topic of the future of archives. The case study topic indicates that archives are changing in large part due to technological changes, especially digitization and born digital materials, and notes that archivists and historians might be loosing their traditional connection. The first question asks if the archives profession will disappear. I responded that I didn’t think it would, but that it certainly needed to transition to working with digital materials and develop closer relationships or partnerships with libraries, museums, technology companies, and corporations. In my opinion, so much of the historical and background information on the profession was related to its attempts to differentiate itself from these other organization types, especially libraries, that it seemed a discipline struggling for an identity. I think a promising future for archives would be based on shared funding, research, and best practices with other information organizations, so that perhaps there is a bit more of a blur between the different LIS organizational settings, and a more dedicated effort to share resources, knowledge, and techniques. The second question of the case study asks if archives will transition to a role of creator of digital archives, rather than collector of digital archives. I answered that I thought both roles would make sense depending on the archives’ mission and the needs of its users. Again, this represents another transitional role for archives, one in which LIS professionals could leverage not only their traditional information skills, but also their technological skills. I feel these thoughts are still relevant today and highlight some aspects of current LIS organizational settings that are one the cusp of change.</p>

                        <p>The LIBR 200 post on ways to manage budget constraints in public libraries, the LIBR 204 post comparing LIS job postings in public and academic libraries, and the LIBR 256 post on the future of archives all support my understanding of the similarities and differences in the organizational settings in which library and information professionals practice.</p>
