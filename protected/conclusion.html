                       <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                       <p>When I began the MLIS program in the fall of 2012, my thought was to work in a museum, archives, or special collections library. Through course work, volunteer experience, readings, contemplation, and life occurrences, I decided to transition to the web programming and information architecture career pathway. As I think often happens, my idea of archival and preservation work was rather romanticized. Through volunteer experience with archival description and through readings that provided an understanding of archival theory, I came to the conclusion that perhaps I was not well suited for such a career. Thankfully, it was at this time that my first technology courses were taken, and those courses helped me to see an alternative career path that was interesting and fulfilling and utilized my strengths. From my experiences as an MLIS student, SLIS student assistant, and my previous fulltime positions, I know that I am a proactive self-starter who is organized, reliable, and productive. I accept challenges and enjoy the process of problem solving and ultimately finding a workable solution.</p>

                        <p>As outlined in my professional philosophy, my growth plan is related to expanding my web programming and design skills through books and online classes and tutorials. Keeping abreast of the latest developments will also be accomplished through reading online magazines and blogs like A List Apart and Smashing Magazine, and attending conferences related to web programming like An Event Apart and the RWD Summit.</p>

                        <p></p>I have enjoyed my time in the MLIS program. It has been a challenge that I am proud of completing. The flexibility of the online program has been vital in that, for my husbandâ€™s work, we have moved from San Diego, to Portland, to Seattle during these two years, and the most significant impact on my schooling was the need to change my mailing address. I have also greatly appreciated the vast majority of my SJSU SLIS professors and lecturers who have been so excited to teach, are earnest and caring in their efforts, and consistently encouraging of all students. Fellow students have been equally impressive with their commitment to their educational goals while working fulltime. They have been willing to share their experiences, ideas, advice, and encouragement with other students and that has been heartening to see. SJSU SLIS has created a welcoming, supportive, and motivational community, and I am glad to have been a part of it.</p>
