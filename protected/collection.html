                        <h2>6. Collection Management</h2>

                        <p>The following discussion of collection management will be based on archival principles and will cover the four main aspects of collection management, including selection/acquisition, evaluation/appraisal, organization/arrangement, and preservation. In the archives realm there is some overlap between selection, acquisition, evaluation and appraisal. For this discussion, I will explain selection in terms of an acquisition or collection policy and evaluation in terms of an appraisal method or process.</p>

                        <p>Simply, an acquisition policy determines what themes and types of materials an archives will consider, accession, preserve, and make accessible. Typically acquisition policies are not required in institutional archives where records of a single company or organization are stored; they are more often used in manuscript repositories or by historical societies and special collections. “An acquisition policy is a written statement prepared by a specific repository to define the scope of its collection and to specify the subjects and formats of materials to be collected” (Hunter, 2003, p. 92). These policies tend to be more like guidelines than strictures. Their development should consider the needs of users/researchers, the theme of any existing materials housed, and the holdings of competing institutions. There should be some understanding that the acquisition policy may change over time due to changes in these considerations as well as availability and format of materials. For example, an acquisition policy that strictly defines an acceptable format as printed material from Seattle’s women’s groups will quickly find that a plethora of topical digital materials effectively fall outside of its purview. An acquisition policy will account for both physical and digital materials if the archives chooses to house both.</p>

                        <p>Evaluation and appraisal require the application of the acquisition or collection policy. Appraisal is the process of determining if the “records in question have sufficient ‘value’ to justify their continued retention in the archives” (Hunter, 2003, p. 51). In institutional repositories without acquisition policies, appraisal decisions are made by assessing the potential long-term or permanent/archival value of records. That value is determined by a number of things including the institution’s mission, goals, and operations, audit or tax requirements as well as legal requirements for records retention. There is also the informational value of the material content to consider, including whether or not it’s unique, how well it will aid researchers, and how important the events, people, or places described in it are for future research. Many other appraisal theories exist, including the ‘black box’ concept, the idea of intrinsic value, and simple sampling methods. It is most helpful for any institution to develop some key guidelines or a defined process for making appraisal decisions and to apply these as consistently as possible. For example, a university special collections might develop an appraisal form that helps to quantify the value of particular records based on the direction included in the acquisition policy. Both physical and digital materials can be appraised in this manner.</p>

                        <p>After materials have been selected, appraised, and accessioned or added to the collection, the work of processing and arranging the materials begins. The principles of provenance and original order form the foundation of archival arrangement. Provenance dictates that the materials from different creators be kept as separate collections. Original order means that materials should be maintained in the order in which the original creator placed them. Per Hunter (2003), there are commonly considered to be five levels of arrangement: repository level (major categories in an archives collection), record group and subgroup (organizationally related records), series (a group of files considered as related), file unit (individual items are housed in files), and item (the individual record or archival material itself). These arrangement levels can be applied to both physical and digital materials.</p>

                        <p>Preservation includes keeping physical and digital archival materials accessible and in useable condition while they are housed in the archives. Importantly, especially for physical materials, this may mean that a copy is put into general use while the original is housed in a secure and safe environment to prevent further degradation. Physical preservation occurs at the item and repository level. Individual items may be surveyed to determine if conservation is required. Conservation may include everything from simple cleaning and repairs to undoing past conservation attempts to hiring expert conservators to help with particularly fragile and unique materials. Repository level preservation techniques include maintaining proper storage environments, disaster-recovery plans, maintaining fire alarms and suppression systems, preventing insect and pest infestation, and developing sound materials handling guidelines for all materials, but especially the very fragile ones. Digital preservation also occurs at the item and repository levels. Item level preservation includes migrating items to new or longer lasting formats and storage devices or emulators to maintain accessibility. Repository level requirements include maintaining storage hardware in working condition, expanding storage as necessary, and migrating to new storage media and servers as required. The same techniques discussed for physical materials (e.g., disaster recovery, fire suppression, etc.) also apply.</p>

                        <p>Collection management’s value to the LIS profession is due to its role in creating and maintaining what is typically the central or core product of any information organization—the materials it stores for use by its audience. Managing the collection properly includes selecting appropriate materials for the audience, following consistent evaluation/appraisal procedures, organizing the collection in a way that allows user access, and preserving the materials to maintain that access over time.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>A <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_discussion_selection.pdf" title="Link to discussion post on selection">discussion post</a> from LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts serves as evidence of my understanding of the selection/acquisition aspect of collection management. The post presents my reaction to two case studies. The first involves de-accessioning decisions made by a staff member—the opposite side of the coin from selection, if you will. As I explained in my response, not only are there ethical issues involved in this case, as the staff member is deciding to remove materials on her own based on her religious beliefs, but de-accessioning should occur in the same way as accessioning, that is, per the acquisition policy. The second question for this case study asks whether or not an acquisition policy will prevent unwanted materials in a collection. I answered that, yes, by definition an acquisition policy would help make this possible; however, as explained above, the policy is a guideline and should be flexible. It will change over time as the focus of the archives shifts or if a superb, though off-topic, collection is offered to the archives. The second case study involves the forced acceptance of a very large collection of Grateful Dead materials only marginally related to the archives’ focus. I explained that I would argue against the acquisition by highlighting the differences between it and the actual focus of the archives. I further explained that the size of the collection would potentially prevent either it or the archives’ other existing collections from being processed in a timely manner due to staffing constraints. I highlighted the institution’s lack of resources to handle the material formats, suggested an investigation into number of researchers likely to take advantage of the collection, and recommended a cost analysis to determine a projected expense for accepting, processing, and housing the collection. The final part of the post is devoted to my plan for actually processing and housing the collection should it be acquired against my recommendation. I feel my analysis of these situations was sound and would not make any adjustments today.</p>

                        <p>My evaluation/appraisal example also comes from LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts and is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_assignment_evaluation.pdf" title="Link to assignment on evaluation">digital files/records appraisal assignment</a>. The assignment was completed using appraisal templates provided by the professor, and I think the templates show significant value in their ability to quantify a collection and maintain consistency in quantifying multiple collections to aid in appraisal decisions. For the assignment, we were tasked with evaluating four digital series of our choosing from university records the professor shared. The special collection’s acquisition policy was provided as a guide. I completed an appraisal form for each of the four series by deciding to what degree each series met specified criteria relating to the value of information, the cost of retention, and the implications of the appraisal decisions. Each decision was informed by the university’s acquisition policy and assigned a numerical value that was tallied to provide a recommendation about the archival value of the series. I greatly appreciated the quantification that the template made possible and believe this sort of measured, consistent evaluation will facilitate appraisal and simplify decision making about what materials to hold and for how long. For a first attempt at evaluating prospective archival materials per an acquisition policy, my work on this assignment seems reasonable. Certainly, if I had more experience with the special collection and the acquisition policy, my ratings for certain criteria or any given series might be somewhat different.</p>

                        <p>Another assignment from LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts serves as evidence of my understanding of collection organization. This <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_assignment_organization.pdf" title="Link to arrangement assignment">assignment</a> involved creating a processing plan at the series and sub-series level for the Cranston Papers. I was informed in my decisions by the university’s processing manual, which was provided by the professor. My first step in creating the plan was to research Alan Cranston to gain a better understanding of the man and his work, his most significant accomplishments, and his family relations. I then reviewed the description of the papers to work out a reasonable way to arrange them into series and sub-series. I chose to arrange the papers into 12 series. The first included personal papers while the next 10 related to Cranston’s professional life both his pre-senatorial and senatorial career, and the final series was devoted specifically to photographs. The sub-series further divided the series into groups of related files. This processing plan will form the basis for the physical (where feasible) and intellectual arrangement of the collection as well as provide a framework for creating the finding aid that researchers will use to initially interact with the collection. Such a processing plan could be used for both physical and digital collections, though it is more likely that it would be used with a physical collection, certain papers of which would be digitized and made available through the likes of the Online Archive of California. As with the appraisal exercise, I believe my processing plan was reasonable for a first attempt. More exposure to archival collections and the guidelines of this particular university would undoubtedly result in changes to it.</p>

                        <p>Evidence of my understanding of the preservation aspect of collection management comes from two sources. The first is the “Digital Preservation: Fragility and Process” section of my LIBR 200 Information and Society <a href="pdfs/LIBR200_Lafranchise_FinalPaper.pdf" title="Link to digital preservation paper">final research paper</a>. I explained that the key to preserving digital collections is to employ an ongoing process of migrating materials to new file formats when required, replicating materials as back-ups, and employing software emulators where necessary to preserve access. This process is required due to constant storage medium, format, and software obsolescence, any one of which left unaddressed will result in the loss of collection material. As I highlighted in the paper, considered from one perspective, libraries and archives have employed a preservation process for ages, regardless of medium. It is the massive amount of digital information in myriad formats that make digital preservation such a challenge and such an integral part of collection management. I still stand by this view of digital preservation today. It will be incredibly interesting to see what the next decade brings in terms of long-term preservation technology as well as hardware, software, and format changes. Preservation of physical materials is the topic of my second piece of evidence, <a href="pdfs/LIBR256_discussion_preservation_physical.pdf" title="Link to discussion on physical preservation">a discussion post</a> from LIBR 256 Archives and Manuscripts. The scenario presented was one in which the university president came to me as head of special collections requesting that the university’s original charter be cleaned, repaired, and framed. Questions asked were whether repairs would affect the documents integrity and what treatments I would suggest for the piece. My responses to the first question were all rather dependent on the realities of the situation. As I expressed, my concern with framing would be limitations to research use and potential for light damage depending on the exhibition environment and framing materials. I suggested that perhaps a replica could be exhibited with the original kept in the closed stacks. My recommendations on cleaning were dependent on how and when the ink smudge in question came to be on the charter. In my mind, if it was made relatively close to the document’s creation date, then it should be left in as part of the document’s history. Finally, I said that mounting the charter to acid-free board seemed like a reasonable preservation technique. In answer to the question about treatments, I suggested fixing tears, paper strengthening, humidification and flattening, and de-acidification of the paper. My final recommendation was to bring in a professional conservator to address the ink smudge, address potential issues with light exposure, and propose either a solution for the mounting and framing or stipulate that they should not be attempted. Looking at my preservation decisions today, I feel that mounting the charter would not necessarily be a good idea. There may be watermarks or other impressions made on the charter (and of interest to researchers) that might only be legible when light was shone through the paper. Other than this, I am still comfortable with the recommendations I made in this discussion post.</p>

                        <p>The LIBR 256 discussion post on selection/acquisition, the LIBR 256 appraisal exercise, the series and sub-series arrangement assignment from LIBR 256, the digital preservation process section of my LIBR 200 final research paper, and the physical preservation discussion post from LIBR 256 combine to demonstrate my understanding of and competency in collection management.</p>
