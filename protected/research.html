                        <h2>12. Quantitative and Qualitative Research</h2>

                        <p>Research is about finding and filling gaps in knowledge. It can also be about testing and reinterpreting previously held theories as well as deriving new theories. Fundamentally, for me, research is about gaining a more thorough understanding of the human experience and impacting it in some positive way—whether that is by researching cures for cancer, testing the effectiveness of library metadata, or by examining the connection between 17th century English shop signs and printers’ marks to deduce something about the semantic discourse occurring in St. Paul’s Cathedral Churchyard.</p>

                        <p>Quantitative research involves a numerical measurement and interpretation of a situation—basically, show me this event, group of people, outcome, phenomenon, etc. through the numbers that represent it. Methods for gathering such data are varied and can include things like patron surveys that ask how many books a person reads in a given month or how satisfied they are with library services on a scale of 1 to 10, statistical analyses of circulation figures and collection holdings, analysis of website statistics such as number of visitors and number of page views, data mining of large data sets like those of the U.S. Census, or data gained through experimentation like tracking user eye movements and clicks on a web page or site. The goal is to collect sufficient numerical information that it can processed through some level of statistical analysis and then interpreted to tell a story about what was actually happening in a particular situation or what might happen in a similar situation.</p>

                        <p>Qualitative research is focused on understanding a situation through the people and artifacts involved in it. The data collected is not numerical, but rather is based on texts, objects, and people’s thoughts, needs, and emotions. Methods include interviews, open-ended or free-text survey questions, artifact excavations, text comparisons, art object comparisons, and focus groups. Researchers then glean commonalities from each collection of data, either based on criteria the researchers define, patterns they recognize in the data, or according to existing theories from disciplines like sociology, anthropology, psychology, art history, etc. The goal is the same as for quantitative research, namely to review the information and draw conclusions from it that describe and explain what was happening to a group of people in a particular environment and possibly extrapolate those conclusions to similar situations.</p>

                        <p>Both quantitative and qualitative research involve several fundamental steps: formulating a research question based on an evaluation of past research/literature; ascertaining the kind of information and data that will reveal an answer to that question; collecting and evaluating that information to come to a conclusion; and, sharing all of the above with others who need or want to know thus expanding the body of existing research (Dickey, 2013). For the LIS fields in particular, research should help to understand users’ motivations and needs, how to meet these needs in programs and services, the effectiveness of these programs and services, and how they can be improved.</p>

                        <h2>Evidence</h2>

                        <p>As evidence of my ability to evaluate and synthesize research literature, I provide my LIBR 200 Information and Society <a href="pdfs/LIBR200_Lafranchise_FinalPaper.pdf" title="Link to digital preservation research paper">research paper</a>. Digital preservation’s goals, challenges, and future were the topics. I initially evaluated close to 60 sources, finally culling down to the 40 that were ultimately synthesized to craft the arguments in the paper. Sources were related to
                                <ul>
                                        <li>the goals of digital preservation (including making analogue and born-digital materials accessible for use to a broad/global audience and maintaining accessibility);</li>
                                        <li>the decision about what gets preserved (the unique for analogue, the ubiquitous and comprehensive for born-digital);</li>
                                        <li>the current accepted process used by libraries and cultural heritage institutions to preserve digital materials;</li>
                                        <li>the possibility of partnerships between cultural heritage institutions;</li>
                                        <li>the creation of a single online portal for libraries, archives, and similar organizations;</li>
                                        <li>the necessity for cultural heritage institutions to actively promote their digital collections;</li>
                                        <li>the need to educate the general public and scholarly audiences on archiving their materials, especially those that are born-digital;</li>
                                        <li>methods for achieving very long-term preservation; and</li>
                                        <li>ways to enhance the usability of digital collections through technology.</li>
                                </ul>

Each of these sections was supported by the opinions, ideas, and research of LIS and related professionals. The path that I wove through the ideas expounded in the various sources provided an overview of the current state of digital preservation c. 2012 as well as proposed some interesting ways in which digital collections might be improved in the future and what this might mean for cultural heritage and information organizations. Decisions as to what was relevant and promising were based solely on my assessments after the fairly in-depth literature review, meaning after a thorough evaluation of sources, I synthesized a reasonably compelling argument and expressed it through my research paper. Looking back on this paper now, I have a different perspective about how best to provide access to not only digital, but also analogue materials. While I originally recommended a partnership between cultural heritage institutions to provide a joint interface as an alternative to search engines, I now feel that the best approach is to catalog and index materials using metadata such that search engines can retrieve those materials. This idea is largely informed by an OCLC research report by Jennifer Schaffner wherein she describes the importance of metadata. She specifically exhorts archives and special collections to forego the development of custom interfaces for the searching of their collections. She says that with the advent and fundamental acceptance of search engines, knowledge repositories “no longer control discovery, [therefore] the metadata [they] contribute is critical. In so many ways, the metadata is the interface” (Schaffner, 2009, p.4). This paper certainly offers several avenues for further investigation and possible applications to improve LIS services. For instance, a library could review and possibly amend its preservation process based on the information provided, or begin investigating long-term preservation options. A library or archive may also consider sharing public domain works in its digital collection with the Digital Public Library of America or the World Digital Library. Equally, investigation into future technologies and ways to enhance archives (e.g., 3-D scanning and augmented reality) provide entry points to begin planning future LIS service improvements. (Incidentally, this paper was the second of two nominated by SJSU SLIS for the Society of American Archivist’s 2013 Theodore Calvin Pease Award.)</p>
                        <p>Further evidence of my ability to evaluate research literature can be found in one of the <a href="pdfs/LIBR280_Lafranchise_ArticleReview1.pdf" title="Link to article review">article reviews</a> I wrote for LIBR 280 History of Books and Libraries. I reviewed a quantitative analysis of manuscript pricing in 14th and 15th century England by Joanne Filippone Overty. I thought Overty’s premise was interesting and compelling: to investigate the economic situation related to manuscript production in the late Middle Ages (which she notes as a gap in existing historical knowledge) with the intention of adding new detail to the shift from monastic to commercial production in the book trade as well as the trade’s response to increased vernacular literacy. I appreciated that Overty was honest about the fact that finding sufficient amounts of pricing data to support her research was difficult and that her results were based on what she was able to cull from primary and secondary sources. I then detailed a rather exhaustive review of Overty’s methods and results, and proceeded to an evaluation of her arguments from the perspective of the data and research she quotes and from the perspective of her data presentation. I reviewed Overty’s background and found that her previous education and research gave her a unique frame of reference for the topic at hand. I applauded her specificity in terms of the scope of her research as well as the three research questions she posits. I also appreciated her honesty regarding the dissimilarity of the data from which she drew conclusions, as it became more apparent the further one read in her article. I noted points where her data was actually very compelling, as well as points where the data contradicted the trends she was establishing and wished that she would have made some comment on these exceptions. Next, I commented on statistical relevancy issues related to the very small sample sizes of her data (which was, of course, simply due to the lack of extant primary sources) and noted some areas where her assumptions tended to weaken her argument. I then explained what I found to be the weakest part of her research, namely that her textual argument is not exactly supported by the actual data she includes in her report, and suggested some alternate explanations based on the actual data. Additionally, I highlighted one instance where there appears to be an error (oversight?) between a graphical representation of her data and the actual data table she included in the appendix, going so far as to re-create her graph with the missing bit of data. The rest of my review is focused on ways that Overty might improve the graphical presentation of her data, largely based on the work of Edward Tufte (2001). I believe the above proves a facility for the evaluation of scholarly research, and I stand by my analysis today.</p>
                        <p>My next evidence for this competency actually comes from two related pieces written for LIBR 285 Research Methods in Information Science. The first is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR285_Lafranchise_BibliographicEssay.pdf" title="Link to bibliographic essay">bibliographic essay</a>; the second, the <a href="pdfs/LIBR285_Lafranchise_FinalProposal.pdf" title="Link to final research proposal">final historical research proposal</a>. By including both, I intend to illustrate my evaluation of the sources with regard to my research topic and synthesis of those sources into the final literature review of the proposal. (To clarify, the culminating project of the class was limited to the research proposal.) As I believe the bibliographic essay exhibits, I evaluated many sources for relevance to my initial research topic, which was to support the argument that publishers, booksellers, and printers working in St. Paul’s churchyard during the 17th century understood the importance of crafting their brand identity and that this identity was embodied in their printers’ devices and shop signs. The essay and sources were categorized into sub-topics relevant to my proposed research, including
                        <ul>
                                <li>17th century England and its book trade;</li>
                                <li>St. Paul’s Churchyard;</li>
                                <li>shop signs and printers’ marks;</li>
                                <li>marketing, branding, and the meaning of symbols; and</li>
                                <li>a selection of primary sources relating to printers, stationers, and booksellers.</li>
                        </ul>
In total, 35 sources were evaluated, categorized, and synthesized for the bibliographic essay. Through further research, evaluation, and synthesis of the literature, the Introduction and Literature Review of the final proposal were created. The first two categories of the bibliographic essay were condensed and moved to the Introduction to set the religious, political, and social stage, and the next two categories became the core of the Literature Review. Primary sources were addressed in the Methods and Analysis subsection of the Research Plan. In the end, a 19-page bibliographic essay was honed into a much more concise and focused eight-page literature review. Because additional primary and secondary sources were found, the final proposal contained close to 45 sources. Several works with topics rather peripheral to my own research topic were reduced to footnotes. However, I felt a strong need to keep mention of many seemingly tangential sources because, for me, they combined to provide a more detailed picture of the current state of research related to shop signs and printers’ marks. Looking back on this project today, the research proposal could certainly be improved, especially through the evaluation and addition of related research into semiotics and the psychological impact and interaction of symbols. In fact, these very subjects were mentioned in the Limitations section of the final proposal. (A quick note: My LIBR 285 professor has added my final research proposal to his portfolio of example work for future semesters.)</p>
                        <p>My final evidence for this research competency is a <a href="pdfs/LIBR281_Lafranchise_Metadata.pdf" title="Link to metadata research project">metadata research project</a> I completed for LIBR 281 Seminars in Contemporary Issues – Metadata. The project consisted of qualitative research into the ability of qualified Dublin Core to describe various resource categories for general web discovery and access. The literature review involved the evaluation of existing literature related to the goals and purpose of both metadata in general and Dublin Core in particular, the successful use of Dublin Core in describing resources, and the situations in which Dublin Core was unsuccessful. This was not an exhaustive analysis and synthesis of all Dublin Core related literature, but rather a focused review of recent literature related specifically to the three topics described above. The methodology of the research consisted of creating five qualified Dublin Core records in each of eight resource categories, including books, ebooks, educational resources, archival materials, visual resources/art objects, web sites/pages, film and video, and scientific data. Existing records in various metadata schemes were crosswalked to the qualified Dublin Core scheme for each resource category—save web sites/pages, which were created directly in qualified Dublin Core, as this was the scheme’s original intended use. The resulting records were analyzed based on overall element usage, and consistency of element usage within a resource category. The findings revealed that qualified Dublin Core was indeed flexible enough to create records in many different resource categories that would enable web discovery and access to those materials. These findings could certainly be applied in LIS settings, especially in those institutions that are seeking ways to increase online access to their collections but are daunted by the task of finding an effective metadata scheme to do so. The results of this research at least provide an impetus to begin an investigation into the possible use of qualified Dublin Core as the metadata scheme that would be flexible enough to describe the full scope of their collections and allow for online access to those collections. Approaching this same research project today, I would make several changes, including increasing the number of records created in each resource category, partnering with catalogers in a library or other information organization, and enlisting the help of someone skilled in statistical analysis.</p>
                        <p>I believe the above discussion displays an understanding of qualitative and quantitative research methods. In particular, the research literature evaluation and synthesis that resulted in my LIBR 200 research paper on digital preservation, the evaluation of quantitative book history research into manuscript pricing completed for LIBR 280, the evaluation and synthesis I completed of past research to craft the bibliographic essay and final qualitative research proposal for my LIBR 285 course, and the qualitative Dublin Core metadata research project undertaken for my LIBR 281 course all evidence an understanding of the methods and purpose of research as well as the value in applying its results to improve programs and services related to LIS fields.</p>
