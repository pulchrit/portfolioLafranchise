                        <h2>10. Information-Seeking Behavior</h2>

                        <p>Information-seeking behavior comes about when a user with an information need attempts to fulfill that need (Rowley & Hartley, 2008; Cleveland & Cleveland, 2013). Information scientists have developed a myriad of principles and theories—several of which are explained below—in an attempt to understand how users search for and use information with the goal of developing interfaces and systems that make the search process as simple and as fulfilling as possible. The central focus of information-seeking behavior is understanding the user, and the reality is that different users search for information differently (Cleveland & Cleveland, 2013).</p>

                        <p>Three principles or laws lay the foundation of information-seeking behavior theories. The first in terms of chronology, is the Pareto Principle, which was defined by Vilfredo Pareto in the early l900s (Morville, 2005). It’s a power law that appears in large, complex, self-organizing systems like language or, by extension, the World Wide Web. Data gathered on such complex systems shows that 80% of the effects are generated by 20% of the causes. This principle is also known as the 80/20 Rule and to provide an example of its application, consider that in a typical large business 80% of the revenue is generated from just 20% of the products. Consider also that for language this means that 20% of the words are used most often.</p>

                        <p>Zipf’s Principle of Least Effort, published in 1949, stems from the Pareto Principle, and Zipf specifically studied human language and gathered data showing how few words are consistently used (Rowley & Hartley, 2008; Morville, 2005; Cleveland & Cleveland, 2013). From the data, he deduced that people are fundamentally engrained with the idea of efficiency; that is they will expend the least amount of effort to solve a problem. The combination of the Pareto Principle and the Law of Least Effort inform information professionals’ in thinking about information-seeking behavior and designing vocabulary, systems, and interfaces to help users find the information they need. As information proliferates on the web, the Law of Least Effort becomes a real force behind user behavior, as does Mooers’ Law (Rowley & Hartley, 2008; Morville, 2005).</p>

                        <p>Mooers published his work in 1959 and his law explains that users will not use an information retrieval system when it is “more painful and troublesome” to get information from it rather than not have that information (Morville, 2005, p. 44). This statement on information-seeking behavior has incredible significance for information retrieval systems, interfaces, and any other services that seek to unite users with the information they need.</p>

                        <p>Considering formal theories of information-seeking behavior, the first I’d like to discuss is Kuhlthau’s. She describes users as going through several stages in searching for desired information. The first involves the recognition of the need itself, “a knowledge gap” between existing knowledge and desired knowledge (Rowley & Hartley, 2008, p. 105). This gap prompts users to determine what topic, if investigated, might fulfill the need. Users investigate the subject area to start to understand its concepts and vocabulary eventually coming to a point where they can specifically define their information need. Then comes the actual collection of information, and the system providing this information is obviously key. The final step involves the use of that information to solve whatever problem or respond to whatever challenge initiated the search.</p>

                        <p>Bates’ berrypicking model provides the next theory of information-seeking behavior. The hallmark of the model is that users do not have a single, focused information query. Their information need and the query that they use to express it changes throughout the search based on results received from previous searches and based on browsing options they choose to employ during the search (Morville, 2005). Relevant documents—like the choicest berries—are not all located in the same set of search results based on a single query; they are scattered through the system. The user will revise their search terms as they learn more about the topic through previous searches. Sometimes it’s the controlled vocabulary of the system that they learn along the way, which aids them in devising more effective search queries. Sometimes it’s a particular citation or journal that catches their eye and draws them to another part of the berry patch. Depending on the goals of their search (i.e., general research versus a known-item search), users may begin to understand that there may not be many relevant documents related to their original topic and might actually shift to another related topic that appears more frequently in the results they are receiving. For me, the main idea is that users are reactive to the environments of their search results; they don’t follow an arrow-straight path to a singular goal, but rather range across the results following promising documents to see where they lead. The impact of this idea of information retrieval on interfaces is significant and at the very least implies the presentation of many options to users, hence we see free text searching, many filtering options on results, related document recommendations, hyperlinks to different controlled vocabulary, citations, journal contents, etc.</p>

                        <p>It is through an understanding of information-seeking behavior that LIS professionals know how to design systems, interfaces, services, and even libraries and archives facilities. If we are acting as gatekeepers and guides to the trove of human knowledge, then an understanding of how different users go about searching will be key in allowing us to meet them at the intersections with appropriate and meaningful maps.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>My first piece of evidence is a brief <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_Discussion_UserPersonas.pdf" title="Link to user personas post">discussion post from LIBR 251 Web Usability</a>, and I include it as an example of the “vital importance of empathy for the user. Only by understanding and caring about the perspective of the individual can we design useful, usable solutions” (Morville, 2005, p. 31). But how can you practically understand the information-seeking behavior of a user? You don’t need an extensive research study to develop a model that suits the particular user of your information resource. Instead, you develop user personas by observing and interacting with several actual users who represent your audience. In the post, I began by referencing several web design guides and blogs that emphasize the value of developing user personas as decision-making guides. I then mentioned the difficulty of creating sound, pertinent, and useful personas. I described the benefit that comes from usable personas: literally, you actually begin to recognize these personas as people, empathize with them, and cater to their information needs because you care to do so. I conclude with an example of the utilization of user personas at a previous employer. The personas were employed to guide decision-making during the interface development for a new software product. They were constantly consulted during the process and allowed for easier and better decision-making. I agree with the simple, yet powerful, point of this discussion post today.</p>

                        <p>My <a href="pdfs/LIBR247_Assignment1_IndexingAbstracting.pdf" title="Link to indexing and abstracting assignment">indexing and abstracting assignment for LIBR 247 Vocabulary Design</a> serves as my next piece of evidence for this competency. We were tasked with developing index terms and an abstract for an article in Online Information Review and then comparing our terms and abstract with that of the ERIC database. Index terms were pulled from the controlled vocabulary of the ERIC thesaurus. Morville explains the power of controlled vocabulary as its ability to increase precision of search results for users (2005, p. 53). Further, as Bates explains below, the indexer has to understand his or her user and their information-seeking behavior in order to select appropriate index terms:
The user’s task is to describe something that, by definition, he or she does not know . . . . the challenge for the indexer is to try to anticipate what terms people with information gaps of various descriptions might search for in those cases where the record in hand would, in fact, go part way in satisfying the user’s information need. (1996, p. 1187). My attempt in this exercise was to select index terms that would enable a subscriber to Online Information Review to find this particular article (which coincidentally reports on research into the search skills of middle school children). Selected controlled vocabulary had a high specificity for this audience, that is, knowing these users would be searching the ERIC database, I attempted to select terms that would appeal to their particular interest in online information organization and search behavior. I want to also briefly mention the abstract created for this article. In my mind informative abstracts like this one are essential in preventing the negative outcome of Mooers’ Law when coupled with the information explosion. Providing informative abstracts that can, for a significant portion of the audience, substitute for the complete article helps to alleviate some of the anxiety and pain that users might experience when confronted with the daunting task of trying to assimilate information from a myriad full articles. The abstract is a way to short-circuit the flight response in that it provides an approachable summary of reasonable length.  User focus in selecting index terms and informative abstracts are ways that library services can be adapted to the information-seeking behavior of their users. As this was a relatively recent submission, I would make no changes to it.</p>
                        <p>A second <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_Discussion_WebUsabilityPrinciples.pdf" title="Link to post on web usability">post from LIBR 251 Web Usability</a> demonstrates another aspect of competency in the understanding of information-seeking behavior and its impact on LIS services. Cleveland and Cleveland provide an appropriate introduction for this evidence:  “User interfaces are of paramount importance in an information retrieval system. . . . It is the interface that ensures a smooth operation and control of human error. . . . Effective user interfaces are intuitive and logically designed” (2013, p101). In this post, I highlighted one simple feature of a course website interface designed by my LIBR 240 instructor. I evaluated this feature in light of three web usability principles—principles that ultimately address aspects of user information-seeking behavior. The feature is simply a dropdown menu that automatically updates the assignment number depending on the date. It’s a feature included on the assignment submission page of the site, and it not only organizes student submissions for students, but also for the instructor. The dropdown can be changed as necessary, for instance, if a student was submitting work earlier or later than the week in which it was due, but the point is that for the majority of users it will exist in the state in which they need it to exist when they submit an assignment. Through the rest of the post, I describe how this feature fits into Tognazzini’s Anticipation principle about proactively catering to user needs, Tesler’s Law about reducing task complexity, and the Poka-Yoke Principle for error-proofing tasks. When students are trying to understand how to submit their assignments appropriately, this feature addresses their information needs simply, intuitively, and automatically. Though it highlights what is really such a simple feature, I think this post does a decent job of explaining how powerful this feature really is in terms of fulfilling users’ information needs.</p>

                        <p>My final piece of evidence comes from LIBR 202 Information Retrieval. It is the <a href="pdfs/LIBR202_A3_SystemEvaluation.pdf" title="Link to system evaluation">evaluation of the Multnomah County Library website and OPAC</a>. In particular, I believe the section entitled Evaluation of Search Features and Functions is pertinent for this information-seeking behavior competency. I gleaned a set of the 12 key features of useful and usable information retrieval systems from two research reports into user information-seeking behavior and evaluated the Multnomah County Library site in light of this list. I don’t think these 12 features constitute a model or theory of behavior, rather I believe they provide practical heuristics that can be applied to improve library web services. The features are quickly summarized below.</p>

                                <ol>
                                        <li>A metasearch of all library assets from a single search field—something akin to what users have become so familiar with through search engines.</li>
                                        <li>Automatic mapping of keywords to controlled vocabulary.</li>
                                        <li>Automatic suggestion of related works based on author, title, and subject.</li>
                                        <li>Spell checking or auto-correction of spelling errors.</li>
                                        <li>Display of reviews and recommendations from other users.</li>
                                        <li>Display of the search terms on the results page, along with (or inside of) a search box.</li>
                                        <li>Some sort of limit on the search results displayed on the first results page to prevent users from feeling overwhelmed.</li>
                                        <li>Availability of items displayed on the results page.</li>
                                        <li>Visual and value-added information on the results page, like the covers of books and professional reviews.</li>
                                        <li>Ability to switch easily from the results page to an individual result.</li>
                                        <li>Any links clicked on the search results page should change color to show they have been visited.</li>
                                        <li>Search keywords should be highlighted on the results page.</li>
                                </ol>

                        <p>The evaluation provides a synopsis of if or how the Multnomah Country Library website fulfills each of these best practices. I think this is a good list of features to use in the evaluation of information retrieval interfaces today and actually used a revised version of the list for an evaluation of online archives for LIBR 256.</p>

                        <p>The evidence described above including the post on developing user empathy through the creation of user personas, the index terms and abstract derived to aid users seeking information relevant to a particular Online Information Review article, the discussion post reviewing a particularly effective user interface design element, and the list of 12 heuristics for effectively meeting the search needs of OPAC users combine to demonstrate my understanding of information-seeking behavior and how such an understanding can be applied to improve LIS services.</p>
