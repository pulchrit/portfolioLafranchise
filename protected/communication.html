                        <h2>13. Communication Skills</h2>

                        <p>I think the complexity involved in communication—though not always recognized until a person is confronted with a very different and possibly incomprehensible form of communication—is succinctly explained by Korzybski’s phrase “the map is not the territory” (Wilson, 2007). While we are all trying to communicate our reality to others using words, we all are a little bit trapped in the maps/models we’ve made for ourselves. It takes practice and familiarity with your audience and its maps/models to find the best words, metaphors, etc. to convey your sense of reality—your sense of what’s going on, of what needs to be done to accomplish goals, and why those goals are important—to those listening. For me personally, I think poets are most effective at communicating, but they do need an audience who is willing to hear. Their facility with language and metaphor allows them to convey the reality of a situation (i.e., the territory) through words (i.e., the map) that bring the listener out of his or her map or mental model and into a new one devised by the poet to the end of increasing understanding of a reality, situation, feeling, or thought that we all actually experience.</p>

                        <p>Putting semantic theory aside, there is a very practical need for communication in information and other organizations and that is to accomplish a specific task. The first step in communicating effectively (whether oral or written) is to know your audience. How do you do this? It’s the flip side of communicating: listening. Specifically, it’s beneficial to listen with the intent of understanding how best to communicate with individuals or groups. What form of communication do they prefer? What metaphors or context are recognizable to them and hence useful to you in your efforts to communicate? For example, are you preparing to host story hour or are you preparing to teach an adult literacy class. The next key is to have some facility with language. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you use proper grammatically correct English in every situation, but rather it means you know when to be professional and when to be casual, and, again, this is dependent on the situation and the audience. For example, writing a Facebook post for a library is going to require a more casual approach than writing a strategic plan or advocacy presentation to show to a funding agency. Additionally, understanding your own goals for the communication well enough to clearly articulate them is vital. And with this should come an understanding of the resulting benefits of achieving those goals for the audience. This second part is the “What’s in it for me?” (WIFM) principle. Alternately, you can view this as explaining the value of what you are conveying (e.g., the value to society that comes from historical research, or the value of a list of improvements recommended for a website). Finally, and especially for presentations, review, editing and practice are integral to effectively communicating. In fact, it’s best to get the perspective of another person to ensure that what you intend to say is coming across as clearly as possible.</p>

                        <p>Effective communication is fundamentally important in professional collaboration and presentations in LIS and other organizations. If you are unable to communicate clearly orally and in writing, how can possibly work with others to accomplish a goal? You would literally be, to some degree, incomprehensible, and any contribution you were trying to make would most likely be ignored by the rest of the group. And, again, if you are unable to communicate well, how can you possibly make a persuasive presentation? Especially in LIS environments where many presentations are requests for funding, the inability to coherently present a need, ask for financial support, and explain the projected beneficial results of that financial support is debilitating.</p>

                        <h3>Evidence</h3>

                        <p>Evidence of my collaboration skills comes from the <a href="pdfs/LIBR242_Grp5_Automata_Analysis_GP1_FINAL.pdf" title="Link to collaboration examples">first group assignment</a> in LIBR 242 Database Management. I am the team coordinator/leader of this five-member group. After team assignments, I emailed the team members to ask about meeting day/time and forum. Through several emails we were able to establish the day/time of our regular weekly meetings and that he meetings would occur via a Google Hangout. This weekly oral communication and collaboration helps us to stay on task and provides an opportunity for those who might not prefer email communication to voice their thoughts and suggestions. In preparation for the submittal of the first team assignment, much of the collaborative thinking was done via email with each team member contributing to a degree they felt comfortable with. In reality this meant that I and one other team member did most of the communication in trying to come to an agreement about what entities and relationships to show in our E-R Diagram—the main deliverable of our first group assignment. It took us about 15 emails back and forth until we were able to satisfactorily explain to each other our thoughts and come to a consensus about what to submit. The third aspect of our collaborative communication was in the use of a shared Google Drive folder to submit work for review by the team and to allow the team to contribute comments and edits on particular deliverables of the assignment. In the end, we were able to submit a complete package that all team members found acceptable. It is this document that is provided as evidence as it was the result of oral and written communication to enable collaborative work. (Incidentally, we are still waiting on feedback and a grade for this first assignment.) In terms of making changes to our collaboration, I think we did as well as can be expected considering we’d only just made it into the norming stage of group work at the time of the first assignment’s submission. As the team leader, I think I could be more encouraging of other team members to participate, but I do think there is a fine line between encouraging them and making them feel like they are inadequate collaborators, which would potentially result in them being defensive and actually contributing less. This is certainly something I will experiment with over the rest of the group project.</p>

                        <p>Two documents demonstrate my written communication skills both of which were produced as part of my Student Assistant duties for the SJSU SLIS Internship Program. The first is the <a href="pdfs/StudentAssistant_WrittenCommunication1.pdf" title="Link to first written communication example">series of emails that will be sent to internship site supervisors</a> inviting them to and providing them information for two upcoming Site Supervisor Panel sessions. Site supervisors will present their internship opportunities to SJSU SLIS students at these sessions in the hope of finding qualified interns. The first email is an invitation that explains the purpose of the sessions, the value of those sessions for site supervisors, and basic logistics like day/time and format of the sessions. The email concludes with another quick summary of benefit to site supervisors and the call to action to reserve a spot on one of the panels. It will only be sent to supervisors with active listings in the SLIS internship database to ensure relevancy of the message to the audience. The second email will alert site supervisors to the fact that the panel sessions are full. This is a simple courtesy to let those who were unsure about participating know that the opportunity has past. Subsequent emails will be sent directly to the panelists and include an email that provides detailed information about preparing for the session, a reminder email about the session, which also includes the agenda, and a day-of reminder that provides the pertinent information for logging into the online room and presenting. A second document evidencing my written communication skills is the <a href="pdfs/StudentAssistant_WrittenCommunication2.pdf" title="Link to second written communication example">set of student emails that announce the Internship Site Supervisor Panels</a>. The goal is to host an online panel session where SLIS students can learn about internship opportunities first hand and where internship site supervisors can present to SLIS students directly. Secondary goals include promotion of the internship program to SLIS students as well as site supervisors. It is the written communication exhibited in these documents that facilitates the successful achievement of these goals. As these documents were quite recently revised for the upcoming April sessions, they exist in a state I am satisfied with and no significant changes are expected.</p>

                        <p>My presentation skills are displayed in two presentations: one for <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_Lafranchise_presentation.pdf" title="Link to LIBR 251 presentation">LIBR 251 Web Usability</a>, and for <a href="pdfs/LIBR285_Lafranchise_presentation.pdf" title="Link to LIBR 285 presentation">LIBR 285 Research Methods in Information Science</a>. Both presentations were given orally in live virtual sessions in front of the professors and students in each class, though, unfortunately, I do not have recordings of those sessions to share. The <a href="pdfs/LIBR251_Lafranchise_presentation.pdf" title="Link to LIBR 251 presentation">LIBR 251 presentation</a> was a five-minute summary of user testing results for a rework of the SLIS LOTSS tutorial (see final pages of the pdf for my speaker notes). In the real world, this presentation would be given to the website owners or decision makers. The goal was to communicate the improvements made to the functionality of the site through a series of three prototypes and responses from user testing of the prototypes. As the audience was familiar with the LOTSS tutorial interface and its issues, no background information was provided. I started directly with a description of the testers and moved quickly through each prototype, the tasks each tester had to perform, the questions asked of each tester, and the resulting changes made to the prototypes. Again, this audience was familiar with the vocabulary of web usability, the issues with the existing website and the process of user testing, so no exposition was required on these topics. The presentation was strictly used to convey the results of user testing and the subsequent changes made to the website prototypes. In a real world situation, the next step would be to see if the client/website owner/decision maker was happy enough with the results of testing and the current prototype to proceed to development of the new site, or if they felt additional testing and prototyping was required. On the whole, I am happy with this presentation and would not make significant changes to it. The final page of the pdf includes the feedback from the professor on this presentation, and I include it as evidence of my ability to communicate orally as he specifically mentions my speaking voice and ability to convey ideas. The <a href="pdfs/LIBR285_Lafranchise_presentation.pdf" title="Link to LIBR 285 presentation">LIBR 285 presentation</a> was a three-minute summary of my historical research proposal. In the real world the audience would be the institution that would support that research, most likely an academic institution, and the goal would be to receive approval of a sabbatical and funding for the research effort. Assuming this audience knows little about my proposed research, I began with a very brief description of my research topic and then moved to a more detailed explanation of what the research will ideally illustrate about printers’ marks and shop signs in 17th century London. I explained the reason behind the selection of geographic setting as well as defined one of the key terms used to contextualize the research. What follows is an explication of the intended value of the research. I concluded with an example of the complex meanings found in a particular printer’s mark. As recommended by the professor in his feedback on this presentation, I would revise this presentation by expanding on the value of the research. I would do so by explaining its ability to generate future research in the variety of disciplines that it would impact, including book history, semiotics, advertising/branding history, and the history of St. Paul’s churchyard and the city of London.</p>

                        <p>The collaborative work necessary for the first group assignment in LIBR 242, the site supervisor and student email communication from my Student Assistant work, and the two oral presentations completed for LIBR 251 and LIBR 285 demonstrate my understanding of and facility with the oral and written communication skills required for collaboration and presentations in LIS and other organizations.</p>
